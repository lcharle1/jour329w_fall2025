# cns_tags assignment
In your notes.md file, describe what the data is and how it's organized. Can you tell what the most popular tags are? How would you describe determining which were the most common tags?

1. This is a categorized json list of cns tags and their article. You cannot tell that it is supposed to be listing the most popular tags and none of the articles include a description, despite it being a category in the list. Determining what is the most common tags would be strenuous process of looking through each link and listing the tags and seeing how many overlaps there are. 

Choose a story and click on the link, then read the story. Put the URL and the title of the story in your `notes.md` file.
1. Short films and screenplays highlighted District film festivalâ€™s 16th year: https://cnsmaryland.org/2019/10/03/short-films-and-screenplays-highlighted-district-film-festivals-16th-year/ 

Run the following command in Terminal, replacing YOUR_URL with the actual URL. We'll be using a model called Kimi-K2 for this.
1. Command: uv run python -m newspaper --url=https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/09/19/trump-administration-warns-maryland-against-dei-contracts-in-key-bridge-rebuild/ -of=text | uv run llm -m groq/moonshotai/kimi-k2-instruct-0905 "You are an expert at categorizing topics for news stories. Read the text and provide no more than 5 topics."
2. Response: 
- Infrastructure Policy
- Federal-State Relations
- DEI / Affirmative-Action Contracting 
- Budget & Oversight Disputes
- Trump-Moore Political Feud

Evaluation: Was it easy to think of changes? Was it too repetitive? What do you think a better workflow would look like? Be creative: if you could control the whole process, how would it differ?
- For the most part the tags are brief and relevant to the story. 'Budget and Oversight Disputes' could be replaced because there isn't much dispute over tax dollars being wasted - though Wes Moore made a point that tax dollars are not being wasted, which is probably why it noted it - but instead the legality of how contracts are being awared. So 'Contracting Disputes' or 'Contracting Legalities' could be alternatives. The word choice might not be realistic when it comes to people searching for tags or stories. If I was looking for the same story I would use 'Bridge Construction' rathter than 'Infrastructure Policy'. I tested this theory and searched 'Bridge Construction' in the CNS search bar and my story was the first one up. I searched 'Infrastructure Policy' and it was not listed in the results. 
- Following my searching experiment I wrote the prompt question to "You are an expert at categorizing tags for news stories. Read the text and provide no more than 5 tags a college student would use to search for the story." It gave me: Key Bridge collapse; Trump DEI warning; Maryland infrastructure; Federal funding politics; Baltimore reconstruction. 4/5 of the new tags were popped up in the search. Key Bridge collpase: 2 page, 2nd option; Trump DEI warning: 1 page, 1st option; Maryland infrastructure: 1 page, 3rd option; Federal funding politics: 0; Baltimore reconstruction: 2nd page, 1st option. In all, I think the word choice of the tags matter a lot. Whether people will actually think of these terms or not.
