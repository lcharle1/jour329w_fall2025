# Immigration Coverage: A Standard Operating Manual for Early-Career Journalists

## Introduction: Understanding the Landscape

Immigration is one of the most dynamic and contested policy areas in American politics, and covering it requires understanding both the immediate human stakes and the complex legal and political infrastructure that shapes immigration outcomes. This manual draws from recent coverage in the region to help you navigate the topic effectively.

The immigration beat encompasses multiple intersecting stories: enforcement actions and their community impact, legal battles over policy, human interest narratives about immigrants' lives, economic analyses of immigration's effects, and state and local policy responses to federal actions. What unites these stories is their focus on how immigration policy translates into lived experience—and how that human reality, in turn, shapes policy debates.

## Key Institutions and Players

**Federal Agencies and Officials:**
- **Department of Homeland Security (DHS)** and its subdivisions, particularly Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), execute immigration enforcement
- **U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)** handles immigration applications and status determinations
- The **Department of Justice**, including immigration courts and the Attorney General, shapes legal interpretation of immigration law
- The **State Department** manages visa processing and refugee admissions

**Key Maryland Figures:**
- **Senators Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin** (both Democrats) have been vocal on immigration issues, introducing legislation and conducting oversight
- **Governor Wes Moore** has made commitments to protect immigrants from state-level cooperation with federal enforcement
- **Maryland Attorney General** Anthony Brown has joined multi-state litigation challenging federal immigration actions

**Advocacy Organizations:**
The region has robust immigration advocacy infrastructure. **CASA de Maryland** is the largest and most influential immigrant rights organization in the state, with extensive community reach particularly in areas like Langley Park (Montgomery County) and Prince George's County. Other key groups include the **Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP)**, **Centro de los Derechos del Migrante**, and various faith-based organizations. Understanding which organizations represent which communities and what their specific focuses are will help you find sources and understand different perspectives on issues.

**Business and Industry Groups:**
Seafood processors, restaurants, construction companies, and agricultural operations depend on immigrant labor. Understanding their perspectives—and their lobbying efforts around visa programs like H-2B—is essential to covering immigration's economic dimensions.

## Critical Story Categories and Patterns

### 1. Enforcement Actions and Their Ripple Effects

Enforcement has accelerated significantly under the Trump administration. Recent coverage shows ICE conducting workplace raids, visiting restaurants and seafood processors, and conducting I-9 audits. 

**What to watch:** The May 2025 raids on DC-area restaurants ([May 15, 2025](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/15/dc-area-food-industry-shaken-after-dhs-visits-more-than-100-businesses/)) illustrate how enforcement creates immediate disruption—workers disappearing, businesses losing staff, communities becoming fearful. When covering enforcement actions, report not just the enforcement itself but its secondary effects: Do schools see declining attendance as parents fear leaving home? Do businesses lose workers? What do service providers report about increased demand for legal assistance?

Notice that these raids often target "D.C. staples"—well-known restaurants. This visibility can be valuable for your reporting; it makes the story real to readers who recognize the establishments.

**Key reporting angles:**
- Worker rights during raids (the right to remain silent, refuse consent to searches, speak to an attorney)
- Employer obligations and liabilities
- Psychological impact on immigrant communities beyond those directly affected
- Whether enforcement targets specific industries or neighborhoods

### 2. Legal Battles Over Policy (Ongoing and Unresolved)

Several major cases remain unresolved as of your reading. The **CASA v. Trump birthright citizenship case** ([May 19, 2025](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/19/nine-people-stand-between-her-child-and-citizenship-its-a-fight-she-cant-afford-to-lose/)) had oral arguments before the Supreme Court in May 2025. The case involves five pregnant women (identified pseudonymously for safety) challenging an executive order that would restrict birthright citizenship. **Caveat:** By the time you're reading this, the Supreme Court may have ruled. If it has, focus on implementation stories: How are hospitals, schools, and local governments interpreting the ruling? Are there new questions about how it applies?

The **wrongful deportation case of Kilmar Abrego García** ([April 10, 2025](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/04/10/lawmakers-join-wife-of-mistakenly-deported-maryland-man-to-demand-his-return/)) shows courts ordering deportations reversed, but the Trump administration refusing compliance. Multiple courts—including the Supreme Court unanimously—ordered his return from an El Salvador prison, yet he remained detained as of April 2025. This is an active accountability story: Is the administration complying with court orders? What leverage do courts have? What does this mean for the rule of law?

**Reporting tip:** When covering ongoing litigation, use cautious language. Don't declare victory prematurely. Note what has and hasn't been resolved, and identify the next legal step or decision point.

### 3. State and Local Policy as Counterweight

Maryland has been particularly active in crafting state-level protections. The **Immigrant Justice Protection Package** ([April 1, 2025](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/04/01/legislation-seeks-to-protect-maryland-immigrants-from-trumps-deportation-push/)) comprises three bills:
- The **Protecting Sensitive Locations Act** (restricts ICE access to schools, hospitals, courthouses, places of worship)
- The **Data Privacy Act** (blocks federal immigration authorities from accessing state databases without warrants)
- The **Maryland Values Act** (targets 287(g) agreements that let local police act as immigration agents)

**Caveat:** These bills were pending as of April 2025. By now they may be law, may have failed, or may have been substantially modified. Check current status and implementation.

These represent an important pattern: states and localities pushing back against federal enforcement priorities. When covering state immigration policy, ask: 
- What does this actually prevent or enable?
- Are there unintended consequences?
- How do law enforcement and federal agencies respond?

The **Maryland Data Privacy Act hearing** ([February 20, 2025](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/02/20/state-may-block-trump-administration-from-maryland-databases/)) illustrates the tension—law enforcement officials worry about losing information-sharing capabilities with ICE, while immigrant advocates emphasize that privacy protections are essential for community trust. Both perspectives are legitimate; your job is to help readers understand the tradeoff.

### 4. Economic and Workforce Stories

Immigration's economic dimensions are underreported. The **Delmarva Peninsula story** ([February 13, 2025](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/02/13/fearing-ice-raids-delmarva-immigrants-mostly-stay-home/)) shows how enforcement fear empties commercial districts, disrupts businesses, and threatens labor supply for agriculture, construction, and hospitality. "Race Street, usually the busy commercial core of a Central American neighborhood, was deserted on a clear weekday evening."

This is powerful reporting. When immigrants stop using public spaces, it signals not just individual fear but potential economic consequences. The story notes that the poultry industry and other sectors could face labor shortages if immigrants flee or stop working.

**For future coverage:** Monitor H-2B visa debates. The seafood industry's reliance on seasonal workers creates recurring policy pressure ([examples from 2022 and 2020](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/11/04/maryland-seafood-industry-to-get-help-with-temporary-worker-visas/)). This is a business constituency that sometimes allies with immigrant advocates on specific issues.

### 5. Impact on Vulnerable Populations

**Unaccompanied immigrant children** represent a particularly vulnerable group. The loss of federal funding for legal representation ([March 28, 2025](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/03/28/loss-of-federal-funds-for-legal-representation-of-migrant-children-carries-disproportionate-impacts-in-maryland/)) means thousands of teens in Maryland could face immigration court alone. Maryland has received a disproportionate share of these children—nearly 40,000 since 2014. Without attorneys, children miss hearings, face deportation orders, and lack advocates to help them understand their rights.

When covering child-focused immigration stories, report on:
- The specific services affected
- Where children are located (Maryland received concentrations in Prince George's County—13,000 there alone)
- What alternatives exist or don't exist
- The decision-making framework (will children try to proceed pro se? Will organizations scramble to find pro bono counsel?)

## Emerging Story Ideas and Undercovered Angles

Based on the coverage reviewed, here are story areas deserving more attention:

### 1. **Long-term Impacts of Enforcement Fear**
We have good snapshots of immediate panic (the Delmarva story, the DC restaurant raids), but less longitudinal reporting on sustained impacts. **Story idea:** Conduct a six-month or one-year follow-up in a community that experienced enforcement action. Have people returned to normal behavior? Have businesses recovered? Have any families relocated? What's the lasting psychological impact on children who grew up during this period?

### 2. **The Chinese Student Visa Story Needs Depth**
The [May 6 story](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/06/caught-in-the-crossfire-chinese-students-navigate-us-china-tensions/) on Chinese students having visas revoked is underdeveloped. **Story idea:** Interview Chinese graduate students at University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins about visa revocations, visa delays, and concerns about surveillance. What fields are most affected (STEM)? Are students choosing other countries? What's the impact on university research and enrollment?

### 3. **Workplace Rights and Wage Theft**
Historical coverage shows wage theft is endemic in immigrant communities (the [2017 coverage](https://cnsmaryland.org/2017/05/18/stolen-paychecks-how-immigrant-workers-get-ripped-off/) is excellent). **Story idea:** Revisit this in the current enforcement environment. Are workers more reluctant to report wage theft because they fear deportation? Has the problem worsened or improved? What enforcement tools exist at state and local level?

### 4. **Housing Instability and Immigration Status**
We see references to shared housing, landlord-tenant issues, and difficulty renting without documentation. **Story idea:** Report on housing access for immigrants with various statuses. How do landlords screen tenants? Are there discrimination issues? What resources exist for undocumented renters in Maryland?

### 5. **Medical Access and Immigration Status**
Immigration status affects health care access but gets little coverage in immigration reporting. **Story idea:** Report on how immigrants navigate health care (especially emergency room visits, maternal care, mental health services). Are hospitals screening immigration status? What's the impact of enforcement on public health (e.g., do immigrants avoid seeking care)?

### 6. **The Implementation Gap: What's Actually Happening with Van Hollen's El Salvador Legislation**
Van Hollen introduced legislation ([May 1, 2025](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/01/van-hollen-and-fellow-democrats-plan-senate-vote-on-trump-deportation-policy/)) requiring the administration to report on compliance with court orders regarding wrongful deportations and to assess El Salvador's human rights record. **Story idea:** What's the status of this? Has the Senate voted? If it passed, is the administration complying with reporting requirements? Are the human rights assessments happening? If it failed, why?

### 7. **Probation Before Judgment and Immigration Consequences**
The [2022 coverage](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/02/05/bill-aims-to-reform-law-that-means-second-chance-for-most-but-can-trigger-deportation-for-maryland-immigrants/) of the "Probation Not Deportation" bill is excellent but hasn't been updated. **Story idea:** Did this bill pass? If so, how is it being implemented? Are judges using the new procedure? Are immigrants accessing this pathway?

### 8. **287(g) Agreements: Are They Actually Being Used?**
Three Maryland counties have 287(g) agreements ([December 2019 reporting](https://cnsmaryland.org/2019/12/18/across-maryland-counties-and-universities-boost-revenue-through-ice-contracts/) shows Cecil, Frederick, and Harford). **Story idea:** How actively are these agreements being used? Are local officers actually conducting immigration screening? What's the data on arrests and referrals? Are there cases where the wrong person was targeted?

### 9. **Visa Denials Based on Tattoos and Profiling**
The [2024 Supreme Court case](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/04/23/justices-consider-case-involving-visa-denied-to-husband-of-u-s-citizen/) involving Sandra Muñoz illustrates visa denials based on alleged gang membership inferred from tattoos. **Story idea:** How common is this? Are there patterns in who gets denied? How can applicants challenge these determinations?

### 10. **Second- and Third-Generation Integration Stories**
Most coverage focuses on recent immigrants or current policy. **Story idea:** Interview 1.5-generation and second-generation immigrants in Maryland about their experience—how has immigration policy shaped their lives and identities? Are second-generation immigrants moving away or staying? 

## Reporting on Unresolved Cases: A Cautionary Note

Several stories you'll encounter remain in flux:

- **Birthright citizenship litigation** ([May 2025](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/19/nine-people-stand-between-her-child-and-citizenship-its-a-fight-she-cant-afford-to-lose/)): Supreme Court heard arguments; decision pending. Use language like "the Supreme Court is considering" rather than predicting outcomes. Focus on the human stakes (Meny's unborn child) and the legal questions (is birthright citizenship guaranteed by the 14th Amendment).

- **Kilmar Abrego García's detention** ([April 2025](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/04/16/maryland-lawmakers-legal-experts-press-trump-to-return-abrego-garcia-from-el-salvador/)): Multiple courts ordered his return; Trump administration refused; case remained unresolved. When reporting on this, be clear: "As of April 2025, Abrego García remains detained in El Salvador despite court orders." Don't imply the case is closed.

- **Maryland legislative efforts** ([April 2025](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/04/01/legislation-seeks-to-protect-maryland-immigrants-from-trumps-deportation-push/)): The Immigrant Justice Protection Package was pending. Check whether these bills passed, failed, or are still in committee.

**Best practice:** Always include a sentence noting the current status of unresolved matters. This protects you and your readers.

## Key People and Institutions to Know

**National figures:**
- **Krish O'Mara Vignarajah** (Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, Baltimore-based) — appears frequently on refugee and legal aid issues
- **Jossie Flor Sapunar** (CASA communications) — reliable source on immigrant rights organizing
- **Jonathan White** (HHS Public Health Service) — testified to Congress on family separation trauma

**Maryland-specific figures:**
- **Ninfa Amador** (CASA policy director) — on state-level immigrant protection efforts
- **Del. Jheanelle Wilkins** (D-Montgomery) — sponsor of Protecting Sensitive Locations Act
- **Abel Núñez** (Central American Resource Center) — expert on workplace enforcement and worker rights
- **Natasha Neely** (Pupatella restaurants) — business perspective on enforcement

**Other recurring sources:**
- **Immigration attorneys** (general practitioners and clinic directors) offer legal analysis
- **Faith leaders** often provide moral framing and sanctuary support
- **Local law enforcement** offer public safety perspective
- **Economic researchers** help quantify impacts

## How to Structure Your Stories

**Enforcement/Impact Stories:**
Open with a specific scene or person affected, not abstract policy. The Delmarva story opens with deserted Race Street. The DC restaurant story opens with DHS visits and worker fear. Then explain the policy context, the scale of the issue, and the broader implications.

**Legal/Policy Stories:**
Explain what the law is now, what's being proposed or litigated, what the stakes are, and who's affected. Include quotes from multiple perspectives (advocates, government officials, affected individuals). Be clear about timelines and decision points.

**Enterprise/Investigation Stories:**
Follow a specific community or issue over time. The wage theft and day laborer stories do this well. The Afghan refugee employment story follows individuals through resettlement and job-seeking.

## Important Context for Your Coverage

**Timeline awareness:** The Trump administration's approach to immigration has evolved over two terms and shifted policy significantly even within 2025. Recognize that immigration policy is exceptionally politicized and contested. Your role is to report what's actually happening and what the consequences are, not to advocate for a particular policy outcome.

**Language matters:** Avoid "illegal immigrant" (use "undocumented" instead, or be specific about immigration status). The term "alien" appears in legal documents but carries harsh connotations. When using official terminology, consider defining it.

**Vulnerability context:** Many people you'll interview are in precarious situations. Protect identities when appropriate (note how the Delmarva story uses pseudonyms, how the birthright citizenship litigation uses first names only). Ask subjects what they're comfortable with before publishing.

## Conclusion

Immigration is fundamentally a story about who belongs, who can work, who gets protected, and who bears risk. The policy is complex, but the human stakes are clear. Focus on specifics—particular people, particular workplaces, particular communities—and help readers understand how abstract policy translates into lived reality. That's how you'll tell the immigration story effectively.
