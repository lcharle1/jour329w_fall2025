# Immigration Coverage for Early-Career Journalists: A Guide

Immigration is one of the most consequential and contested policy areas in contemporary American journalism. For early-career reporters looking to cover this beat responsibly, understanding the landscape—its legal frameworks, key players, and how stories connect to broader patterns—is essential. This guide draws from recent coverage to help you ask better questions, find more compelling sources, and contextualize individual stories within systemic trends.

## Understanding the Current Immigration Landscape

The Trump administration's return to office in January 2025 has dramatically reshaped immigration enforcement and policy. Understanding what changed—and what remained consistent—provides crucial context for any story you report.

In May 2025, the federal government was actively conducting workplace raids across the nation. The [DC area food industry experienced particular disruption when DHS visited more than 100 businesses](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/15/dc-area-food-industry-shaken-after-dhs-visits-more-than-100-businesses/), including well-known restaurants. What made this noteworthy wasn't just the enforcement action itself—such raids have occurred under previous administrations—but rather the method and scope. According to immigration advocates quoted in that story, DHS agents typically mail advance notice before conducting I-9 audits, giving businesses time to prepare. The surprise visits marked a departure from standard practice and signaled what advocates described as "a clear attempt to intimidate owners."

This distinction matters. When reporting immigration enforcement, ask: *How does this compare to previous administrations' practices?* The answer often reveals political intention and helps readers understand what's genuinely novel versus what's routine enforcement presented with different rhetoric.

## The Human Cost of Policy: Finding and Telling Individual Stories

Some of the most powerful immigration journalism centers on individuals navigating bureaucratic systems. In May 2025, [a pregnant woman named Meny faced profound uncertainty while participating in a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's birthright citizenship executive order](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/19/nine-people-stand-between-her-child-and-citizenship-its-a-fight-she-cant-afford-to-lose/). Published months after the executive order's announcement, this story illustrates how policy impacts ripple through time, often invisibly.

When covering such stories, remember several things:

**Protect sources carefully.** Meny was identified by first name only, and her legal counsel specifically requested that certain details about her immigration case not be included—not from shame, but from genuine concern about retaliation. Ask subjects what information might endanger them or their families. Immigration attorneys can help you understand these risks.

**Understand the timeline.** Meny's story wasn't urgent news breaking—it was a deep human consequence of a policy announced months earlier. Don't assume immigration stories have short shelf lives. Sometimes the most important reporting happens when you step back from the immediate to examine what's actually happening to people living under new policies.

**Find the institutional context.** Meny's case involved two nonprofit organizations (CASA and ASAP), a federal judge, appeals courts, and ultimately the Supreme Court. Understanding which institutions were involved, and what they represented, helped readers grasp why this case mattered beyond Meny's individual situation. When reporting, identify the key institutions and what stake each has in the outcome.

## Systemic Enforcement and Labor Market Impacts

Immigration enforcement doesn't exist in isolation—it affects entire industries and regional economies. The seafood processing industry provides a useful case study. Over several years, reporting revealed how H-2B visa restrictions created chronic labor shortages, affecting Maryland's Eastern Shore in particular.

When the Trump administration announced additional H-2B visas in April 2021, it seemed like relief. But [the timing was terrible: the coronavirus pandemic was shutting down restaurants and retail](https://cnsmaryland.org/2020/04/22/seafood-industry-visa-fix-collides-with-coronavirus-leaves-great-uncertainty/), destroying demand for processed seafood overnight. What appeared to be a policy victory became meaningless in changed circumstances.

This illustrates an important reporting principle: **track the gap between policy announcements and actual outcomes.** Talk to business owners, workers, and economists. Ask: *What did people expect would happen? What actually happened? Why was there a difference?*

A later investigation revealed troubling conditions for H-2B workers during the pandemic. [In 2021, 59 Mexican workers legally transported to Maryland were put to work the day after arriving without quarantine or COVID testing](https://cnsmaryland.org/2021/05/12/us-deems-migrant-seafood-workers-essential-but-limits-their-covid-19-protections/). Within a week, several tested positive. The story illustrated how "essential worker" designations can mask inadequate protections. When federal and state agencies failed to establish safety protocols, workers bore the risk.

**When reporting labor issues:**
- Talk to workers themselves, but understand that undocumented workers may fear retaliation
- Interview labor advocates, attorneys, and union representatives who see patterns across multiple workplaces
- Request data from state labor agencies about complaints and violations
- Compare how different states handled similar situations (in this case, Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina had very different responses)
- Follow the money: who pays for enforcement, and what do those funding decisions suggest about priorities?

## Understanding Legal Status Categories

Immigration law is dense, but several status categories appear repeatedly in news coverage. Understanding the differences helps you report more accurately.

**DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals)** protects people brought to the U.S. as children. Recipients receive two-year renewable work permits but not permanent legal status. When [Trump terminated DACA in 2017](https://cnsmaryland.org/2017/09/05/maryland-immigrant-rights-supporters-attack-trump-move-as-cruel/), roughly 9,000 Marylanders faced uncertainty. The program created a particular vulnerability: DACA recipients registered with the government, and if the program ended, the government would know exactly where they lived.

**TPS (Temporary Protected Status)** is granted to nationals of countries experiencing armed conflict, natural disaster, or epidemic. It's genuinely temporary—designations can be withdrawn. When the Trump administration moved to end TPS for several countries, [Maryland senators introduced legislation to create a pathway to permanent residency for TPS holders](https://cnsmaryland.org/2017/11/16/maryland-senators-introduce-bill-to-aid-temporary-status-immigrants/), arguing that many had lived in the U.S. for two decades and were deeply integrated into communities.

**Humanitarian Parole** is what Afghan evacuees received. Unlike asylum or refugee status, parole is temporary (typically two years) and doesn't create a clear path to permanent residence. [Coverage of Afghan evacuees resettling in 2021](https://cnsmaryland.org/2021/12/15/temporary-legal-protections-leave-uncertainty-for-afghan-evacuees-resettling-in-the-u-s/) explained how this temporary status hindered their ability to access affordable housing, plan futures, or obtain credit.

When you encounter unfamiliar status categories, ask your sources: *What can people in this status do? What can't they do? How long does this status last? What happens when it expires?* These questions help you explain to readers why legal status matters.

## The Challenge of Data and Transparency

Immigration data is often frustratingly opaque. When [DHS conducted workplace raids across the DC area in May 2025](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/15/dc-area-food-industry-shaken-after-dhs-visits-more-than-100-businesses/), reporters worked to understand the scope but found limited official information. DHS confirmed the visits but provided minimal detail. Some restaurants confirmed they lost employees; others remained silent.

**When seeking immigration enforcement data:**
- Request FOIA documents from DHS, ICE, CBP, and state agencies
- Ask for specific numbers: arrests, detentions, deportations, prosecutions
- Seek comparative data: How do current numbers compare to previous years?
- Look for demographic breakdowns: Where are enforcement actions concentrated?
- Ask about complaints: How many workplace violations were reported? How many investigated?

Agencies often resist transparency. In one seafood processing investigation, state health departments claimed they couldn't disclose outbreak locations due to confidentiality laws. When [Maryland experienced COVID outbreaks at seafood facilities in summer 2020](https://cnsmaryland.org/2021/05/16/trabajadores-migrantes-que-procesan-marisco-en-estados-unidos-desprotegidos-durante-la-pandemia-de-covid-19/), the Dorchester County Health Department acknowledged 50 cases but refused to name which facilities were affected. Reporters had to piece together information through interviews with workers, church members, and advocacy organizations.

**When agencies claim they can't provide information:**
- Ask why specifically (which law or regulation prevents disclosure?)
- Request what *can* be disclosed without violating privacy rules
- Try different agencies (sometimes local agencies have information state agencies claim to lack)
- Interview people affected: they can often describe what happened even if agencies won't

## Finding and Cultivating Sources

Strong immigration reporting depends on trustworthy sources. Consider developing relationships with several types:

**Legal advocates and nonprofit organizations** like CASA, the American Civil Liberties Union, and immigrant resource centers often see patterns across many cases. They can explain how policy works in practice, identify emerging issues, and sometimes connect you with clients willing to share their stories (with careful attention to safety and confidentiality).

**Government officials** vary widely in their willingness to discuss immigration. Some are advocates; others view immigration enforcement as their mandate. Talk to people across the spectrum—prosecutors, sheriffs, ICE officials, immigration judges—but understand their institutional perspectives.

**Workers and community members** are essential but require careful approach. Undocumented immigrants reasonably fear that talking to journalists could lead to deportation. Build trust slowly. Partner with community organizations that already have relationships. Explain specifically how you'll protect identities. Be honest about what you can and cannot guarantee.

**Economists and researchers** can provide context about immigration's economic impacts. When coverage claimed mass deportations would create jobs for Americans, [economists pointed to historical evidence suggesting otherwise](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/12/03/trumps-mass-deportations-could-hit-maryland-economy-experts-warn/). In one story, a economics professor noted that after Arizona's anti-immigration policies led to a 40 percent decline in undocumented workers, the state saw a 2.5 percent decrease in total employment and American-born workers' employment rates declined.

**Suggested sources to approach:**
- Local immigration attorneys (both those representing immigrants and those representing employers)
- Nonprofit organizations serving immigrants (legal aid, workforce development, resettlement agencies)
- Business groups affected by immigration policy (hospitality, construction, agriculture)
- University-based research centers focused on immigration
- State legislators and city council members with immigration portfolios
- Labor unions and worker advocacy organizations
- Faith leaders and religious organizations

## Covering Policy Debates Responsibly

Immigration policy debates often feature competing claims about facts. When reporting, your job is to test these claims against evidence.

**"Immigrants take jobs from Americans"** is a common claim. Research suggests it's more complicated. [One economist explained that unauthorized immigrants often work in different sectors and perform different tasks than native-born workers, so they're "not in competition" but rather "work cooperatively, increasing each other's productivity and wages."](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/12/03/trumps-mass-deportations-could-hit-maryland-economy-experts-warn/) When covering this claim, ask economists for specifics about which jobs, which regions, and what the evidence actually shows.

**"Immigrants are criminals"** is contradicted by research. [A CATO Institute analysis found that illegal immigrants in Texas had lower crime rates than native-born Americans, whether measured by convictions, arrests, or the number of individuals charged.](https://cnsmaryland.org/2019/07/16/brother-of-bel-air-murder-victim-speaks-at-the-republican-convention/) Yet high-profile crimes by immigrants receive outsized media attention, distorting public perception. When reporting individual crimes, contextualize them with data about overall crime rates.

**"Sanctuary city policies hurt public safety"** is asserted by some law enforcement officials. [Other law enforcement leaders argue the opposite: that cooperation with immigration enforcement erodes community trust, making immigrants less likely to report crimes.](https://cnsmaryland.org/2021/03/05/bill-to-rebuild-trust-between-immigrants-and-law-enforcement/) When covering this debate, interview police chiefs and community members in actual sanctuary jurisdictions and compare crime statistics before and after policies were implemented.

## Covering Immigration Courts and Legal Processes

Immigration courts are often invisible to mainstream journalism, but they're where many immigration stories actually unfold. When covering immigration legal issues, understand several things:

**Immigration courts are civil, not criminal.** Immigrants don't have a right to government-appointed attorneys, which means many represent themselves. This affects outcomes significantly. [Data showed that roughly 60 percent of children with cases in Maryland immigration court had legal representation between 2004-2016, while nearly all children with attorneys appeared for their final hearing, but only a third of those without attorneys did.](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/03/28/loss-of-federal-funds-for-legal-representation-of-migrant-children-carries-disproportionate-impacts-in-maryland/)

**Immigration judges have significant discretion.** They can grant relief, deny cases, or dismiss on procedural grounds. When covering specific cases, understand what relief the person is seeking and what legal standard the judge is applying.

**Appeals are limited.** Immigration cases can reach federal appeals courts and sometimes the Supreme Court, but the vast majority of immigration decisions are final. When the [Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that the Trump administration must facilitate the return of a man wrongfully deported to El Salvador](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/04/10/lawmakers-join-wife-of-mistakenly-deported-maryland-man-to-demand-his-return/), it was extraordinarily rare—a unanimous decision on an immigration matter.

**Suggested reporting angles on immigration courts:**
- Examine backlogs (some Maryland courts had over 50,000 pending cases as of early 2025)
- Interview immigration judges about their workload and decision-making
- Track outcomes for represented vs. unrepresented immigrants
- Follow specific cases through the court system over months or years
- Examine how immigration courts operate differently than criminal courts

## Beyond the Trump Administration

While recent coverage focuses heavily on Trump administration policies, immigration is a perennial issue with deeper history. When reporting, provide context:

**Previous administrations also enforced immigration law.** During the Obama administration, deportations increased significantly compared to earlier years. The Trump administration's rhetoric was often more inflammatory, but enforcement levels varied. When comparing administrations, use data rather than rhetoric.

**State and local responses vary.** Some jurisdictions adopted "sanctuary" policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. Others enhanced cooperation through 287(g) agreements allowing local officers to enforce immigration law. When reporting local immigration policy, understand the specific ordinances or agreements in place.

**Immigration is economically complex.** Immigrants contribute to the economy through taxes, labor, and entrepreneurship, but they also compete for housing and services. When covering economic impacts, avoid simple narratives. [One analysis found that Hispanic immigrants in Maryland paid $1.6 billion in taxes while working in sectors facing chronic labor shortages.](https://cnsmaryland.org/2017/09/15/maryland%E2%80%99s-changing-faces-often-are-from-other-countries/) The complexity is the story.

## Final Guidance for Early-Career Reporters

Immigration journalism can feel overwhelming because the policy landscape is genuinely complex, the human stakes are high, and sources may be difficult to access. Here are practical principles:

1. **Understand that immigration policy affects entire ecosystems.** A workplace raid doesn't just affect the individual arrested—it affects families, employers, industries, and communities.

2. **Don't assume you know what matters.** The most important stories sometimes emerge months after major policy announcements, when you can examine actual impacts rather than predicted ones.

3. **Seek competing perspectives but don't treat factual questions as matters of opinion.** Whether immigrants commit crimes at higher rates than native-born Americans is a factual question with research-based answers. Whether immigration policy should prioritize family unity is a values question where reasonable people disagree.

4. **Build relationships slowly.** Immigration sources—particularly undocumented immigrants—have good reasons to be cautious about talking to journalists. Earn trust through consistent, careful reporting.

5. **Use data but understand its limits.** Government data on immigration is often incomplete, delayed, or difficult to access. Use it to identify patterns, but supplement with interviews and on-the-ground reporting.

6. **Remember that immigration is fundamentally about human decisions.** Behind every policy are people deciding where to live, when to move, how to support their families. Those human choices are often more compelling—and more revealing—than abstract policy debates.

Immigration reporting requires patience, care, and intellectual humility. But it also offers the opportunity to explain how policy actually affects people's lives and to challenge simplistic narratives about one of America's most consequential issues.
