# Immigration Policy and Enforcement: A Training Manual for Early-Career Journalists

## Learning Objective

By completing this manual, you will understand the contemporary landscape of U.S. immigration policy—particularly as it has evolved during the Trump administrations and beyond—including key legal mechanisms, affected populations, institutional players, and emerging story opportunities. You'll learn to identify underreported angles in immigration enforcement, recognize patterns across federal and state actions, and understand how policy decisions ripple through communities and industries.

---

## Part I: Understanding the Landscape

### What You Need to Know First

Immigration journalism covers the intersection of law, human consequence, economics, and politics. The stories in your corpus span from May 2025 back to 2017, capturing significant shifts in federal policy. Rather than treating immigration as a single issue, think of it as multiple intersecting systems: **enforcement and deportation**, **legal status pathways**, **family separation and humanitarian concerns**, **labor market impacts**, and **state and local resistance or cooperation**.

The most important thing to understand: immigration policy is not neutral. Enforcement actions have immediate, measurable impacts on real people's ability to work, go to school, access healthcare, and stay with their families. At the same time, the immigration system itself is labyrinthine—truly understanding a deportation case, a visa denial, or a work authorization requires learning specific legal frameworks.

### The Current Moment (May 2025)

Your most recent story (May 19, 2025) involves a pregnant woman named Meny, part of a lawsuit challenging Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on May 15, 2025, in *CASA v. Trump*. This is an **unresolved legal matter**—the Court's decision could come at any time and will significantly reshape who can claim citizenship at birth. This case exemplifies the kind of breaking story you may encounter: high human stakes, constitutional questions, and uncertain outcomes.

Also in May 2025, DHS conducted what appears to be a coordinated sweep, visiting over 100 businesses in the DC area including popular restaurants, serving "Notices of Inspection" for I-9 audits. No arrests were made during the initial visits, but the action created a chilling effect—workers began leaving jobs or staying home from work. This illustrates how **enforcement threat itself is a form of enforcement**, even before arrests occur.

Meanwhile, Chinese students' visa revocations and a Senate effort (led by Maryland's Chris Van Hollen) to require reporting on wrongful deportations to El Salvador show that immigration enforcement is not monolithic. Different administrations, different agencies, and different populations face different pressures.

## Part II: Key Themes and Institutions

### The Deportation Machinery

**The Core Players:**

- **Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)** — the agency actually conducting arrests and removals
- **Department of Homeland Security (DHS)** — oversees ICE and sets policy
- **U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)** — handles border crossings
- **Courts** — immigration courts (separate from criminal courts) and federal courts (reviewing immigration decisions)
- **State and local law enforcement** — through 287(g) agreements, can be deputized to enforce immigration law

**What Deportation Looks Like:**

From your stories, deportation can be wrongful (like Kilmar Abrego García's, a Maryland resident deported to El Salvador despite having legal protected status in 2019, which triggered years of litigation and political pressure). It can be rapid (migrants arriving at the border). It can be built on faulty information (like visa denials based on tattoo misidentification). And crucially, once someone is deported, getting them back is extraordinarily difficult.

The Abrego García case, which spanned from March 2025 through at least mid-May 2025, shows how a single wrongful deportation can become a national story. The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 in April that the government must facilitate his return. Yet the administration resisted. This is a **live unresolved story** that could break again when either he returns or further court action occurs.

### Legal Status: The Fragmented System

Americans often think of immigration status as binary: legal or illegal. In reality, there are dozens of statuses:

- **Permanent Resident (Green Card)** — legal to live and work indefinitely
- **Temporary Protected Status (TPS)** — granted when a country is deemed unsafe; renewable but not permanent
- **Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)** — allows some undocumented immigrants brought as children to work; renewable every two years
- **Asylum status** — protection for those fleeing persecution
- **Special Immigrant Visa (SIV)** — for certain Afghan and Iraqi nationals who aided the U.S. military
- **Humanitarian Parole** — temporary status, often for evacuees
- **H-2B, H-1B, J-1 visas** — temporary work visas
- **Undocumented** — no legal status

The critical story here: many people occupy the cracks between these categories. Afghan evacuees arrived on humanitarian parole (2-year temporary status) with no clear path to permanent residence. Workers under H-2B visas are legally present but dependent on their employers, creating vulnerability to wage theft and unsafe conditions. DACA recipients—nearly 800,000 of them—have lived in legal limbo for over a decade.

**Recent Trend (Important for Story Ideas):** There's movement toward making certain statuses permanent. The "Afghan Adjustment Act" (mentioned in your November 2023 story) would give Afghan evacuees a pathway to green cards. Similarly, Democrats have repeatedly proposed legislation to give DACA recipients and TPS holders permanent status. These bills are **perennially stalled** in Congress, making them recurring story opportunities.

### The Birthright Citizenship Question

The May 2025 *CASA v. Trump* case involves a core constitutional issue: the 14th Amendment states that anyone born in the U.S. is a citizen. Trump's executive order attempted to restrict this to children of citizens or permanent residents. This affects thousands of children born to undocumented immigrants in the U.S.

Why this matters: **If birthright citizenship is restricted, the U.S. would create a class of stateless persons born on American soil.** No other developed democracy does this. The human stakes are enormous. Meny's unborn child would become stateless. This case has not yet been decided as of your publication date; expect the Supreme Court to issue a decision by June 2025 or later.

- How I-9 audits work (employers must verify work eligibility; audits can lead to deportations)
- The 287(g) program (local law enforcement deputized as immigration agents)
- The psychological and economic impact of enforcement threat
- Regional vulnerability (Delmarva Peninsula has high immigrant populations in essential industries like poultry processing)

**Questions to Answer:**
1. What businesses in your region employ significant numbers of immigrants? What would happen if key workers were deported?
2. Has your state or county considered or enacted sanctuary policies? What do they protect and what don't they?
3. Who profits from detention? (Your corpus mentions counties receiving per diem payments to house ICE detainees)

### Module 2: The Courts and Rights (Weeks 2-3)

**Core Reading:**
- April 18, 2025: "Returning from El Salvador, Van Hollen says 'we need to bring Mr. Abrego García home'"

- May 12, 2021: "US deems migrant seafood workers 'essential' but limits their COVID-19 protections" (in Spanish and English)
- May 17, 2017: "When supply exceeds demand, wages for Langley Park day laborers suffer"

**Key Concepts:**
- How H-2B and H-1B visa programs function
- Wage theft and labor exploitation in informal markets
- The paradox of "essential" workers with minimal protections
- How state policy can either protect or expose workers

**Story Patterns:**
- Seasonal workers (like crab pickers) repeatedly face labor shortages and must be lobbied for additional visa allocations
- Migrant workers have fewer legal protections than citizen workers
- Wage theft is endemic in construction, landscaping, and hospitality
- Undocumented workers often don't report violations for fear of deportation

**Questions to Answer:**

## Part V: Undercovered Angles and Story Ideas

### Emerging Opportunities (Next 6 Months)

**1. Birthright Citizenship Resolution**
**Status:** UNRESOLVED; Supreme Court decision expected by June 2025 or later
**Angle:** Track the Supreme Court decision in *CASA v. Trump*. When it comes down, interview:
- Pregnant undocumented immigrants who would be affected
- Constitutional law experts on implications
- Foreign governments' responses (some countries may not recognize children born abroad to citizens as citizens)
- State governments preparing contingency plans

**Where to Report:** Hospitals with high immigrant populations; law schools; state registries

**2. Wrongful Deportation Cases**
**Status:** Abrego García case ongoing; likely others
**Angle:** Investigate whether there are other Maryland residents wrongfully deported. Work with:
- Immigration attorneys
- El Salvador government (which has been forced to house U.S. deportees)
- Congressional offices
- Courts handling habeas corpus petitions

**Why Underreported:** Wrongful deportations are hard to document (records are often confidential) and the people affected are often unreachable (deported abroad). But they represent massive due process failures.

**3. State vs. Federal Policy Divergence**
**Status:** Ongoing
**Angle:** Maryland has proposed sanctuary protections; other states have different approaches. Story: How do states actually protect or expose immigrants when federal policy shifts? Interview:
- State attorneys general
- Local police chiefs (tensions between local law enforcement values and federal pressure)
- Immigrants in states with different policies

**4. DACA Recipients Aging Out / Legal Status Limbo**
**Status:** Recurring; nearly 1 million DACA recipients still lack permanent status
**Angle:** DACA recipients are now in their 20s, 30s. Many bought homes, started businesses, had children (who are citizens). What happens if DACA is terminated? Interview:
- DACA recipients approaching life milestones
- Businesses that employ them
- Lenders (mortgages, small business loans)
- Children (U.S. citizens) of DACA recipients

**Why Now:** DACA is perpetually threatened; getting renewals is uncertain year to year. This creates a permanent population living in legal precarity.

**5. Labor Trafficking and Wage Theft in Essential Industries**
**Status:** Ongoing; March 2025 DC restaurant sweep showed active investigation
**Angle:** Your May 2025 story shows DHS visiting 100+ businesses including restaurants. Investigate:
- Are workers being trafficked or held through debt bondage?
- Wage theft patterns in specific industries
- How employers avoid accountability
- State and federal labor enforcement capacity

**Interview Suggestions:**
- Restaurant owners and workers
- Labor department investigators
- Legal aid attorneys
- Immigrant advocacy groups

**Why Underreported:** Wage theft and trafficking are hard to document; victims are reluctant to come forward; stories require deep background reporting.

**6. The Afghan Refugee Integration Story**
**Status:** Ongoing; Afghan evacuees arrived in 2021; many still on temporary status
**Angle:** Where are Afghan evacuees 4 years later? Have they integrated? Are they employed? What happened to families separated during evacuation? What's the status of the "Afghan Adjustment Act"?

**Interview Suggestions:**
- Afghan families in your region
- Resettlement agencies
- Local employers hiring Afghans
- Congressional offices (status of adjustment act)

**7. Chinese Students and Visa Revocation**
**Status:** Ongoing; May 6, 2025 story notes hundreds of revocations
**Angle:** Investigate:
- How many Chinese students have been affected?
- What are the stated reasons for revocations?
- Are there false positives (students accused of espionage without evidence)?
- Impact on universities and tech companies

**Where:** Universities with significant Chinese student populations; tech companies; State Department

**8. Data Privacy vs. Enforcement**
**Status:** Maryland Bills SB0265/HB0559 and related data privacy proposals moving through legislature (as of April 2025)
**Angle:** These bills would prevent state agencies from sharing data with ICE. Investigate:
- What data is currently being shared?
- How are state databases being used in enforcement?
- What are privacy advocates' specific concerns?
- How are law enforcement agencies responding?

**Why Important:** This is a rare area where Republican and Democratic jurisdictions are taking different approaches; it's a policy experiment.

**9. The Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) / TPS Renewal Cycle**
**Status:** Recurring; DED and TPS statuses are periodically reviewed
**Angle:** Every few years, these temporary statuses come up for renewal. When they do:
- Whom does it affect? (Salvadorans, Haitians, Syrians, etc.)
- What's the economic impact of losing status?
- Are there legislative efforts to make it permanent?
- Families planning for potential deportation

**Where:** Communities with large populations from designated TPS/DED countries

**10. Seafood Industry Labor**
**Status:** Recurring annual crisis; H-2B visa allocation battles happen every spring
**Angle:** Maryland's crab and oyster industries depend on H-2B visas. Each year, there's lobbying for more visas. Investigate:
- How dependent is the industry really on migrant labor?
- What happens when visas aren't granted?
- Are there documented labor violations?
- What are working conditions like?

**This is a **perennial story** that recurs every spring/summer; good for seasonal reporting.**

## Part VI: How to Report Immigration Stories

### Essential Documents to Request

- **FOIA requests to ICE/DHS:**
  - Enforcement operation statistics by jurisdiction
  - I-9 audit results
  - Deportation statistics and destinations
  - Civil rights complaints

- **Court records:**
  - Immigration court decisions (often public)
  - Habeas corpus petitions
  - Appeals

- **Congressional letters:**
  - Congressional offices often write letters to agencies; these are sometimes publicly available
  - Congressional testimony transcripts
  - General Accountability Office reports

### Interview Strategy

**Sources differ by story type:**

**For enforcement stories:**
- Immigrants affected (use pseudonyms for safety)
- Immigration attorneys
- Legal advocacy organizations
- Local police (understand their perspective too)
- Affected employers/industries

**For legal/policy stories:**
- Congressional staffers
- Agency spokespersons (DHS, ICE, USCIS)
- Immigration law professors
- Policy organizations across the spectrum
- State/local officials

**For human interest stories:**
- Immigrants and their families
- Their employers
- Healthcare providers treating them
- Educators
- Faith leaders

### Ethical Considerations

- **Safety:** Undocumented immigrants face real risk from exposure. Use pseudonyms, obscure identifying details, verify consent carefully.
- **Language:** Use precise terminology. "Illegal immigrant" is politically charged; "undocumented" is more neutral but still contested. Describe specific status when possible.
- **Balance:** The immigration debate is polarized. Make sure you understand and represent both pro-enforcement and pro-immigrant perspectives fairly, even if you find one more compelling.
- **Long-term relationships:** Immigration communities are tight-knit. A breach of trust (exposure of an undocumented source, for example) will damage your credibility long-term.

## Part VIII: Timeline Context (Why It Matters)

Your corpus spans 2017-2025. Key contextual moments:

- **September 5, 2017:** Trump terminated DACA (led to years of litigation; program survived but remained precarious)
- **2018:** "Zero tolerance" family separation policy; later reversed but created lasting trauma
- **2020:** Trump lost presidency; Biden won
- **January 20, 2021:** Biden inauguration; promised to reverse Trump immigration policies
- **2021-2024:** Afghan evacuation and resettlement; evacuees remain in legal limbo
- **November 2024:** Trump elected again
- **January 20, 2025:** Trump inaugurated for second term; immigration enforcement ramped up
- **January 2025-May 2025:** Birthright citizenship executive order; restaurant industry enforcement surge; deportation numbers climbing

**Why Timeline Matters:** Immigration policy is cyclical and contingent on who occupies the presidency. Stories you reported as "hypothetical threats" under Biden became active enforcement under Trump. The stakes for immigrants shift dramatically.

## Conclusion

Immigration journalism is complex, emotionally demanding, and essential. The stories in your corpus show immigration as it actually is: people navigating an impenetrable bureaucracy, employers exploiting vulnerability, communities organizing for protection, courts wrestling with constitutional questions, and politicians using immigration as political currency.

Your job is to make that complexity comprehensible without flattening it. Not all immigrants are the same. Not all enforcement is the same. Not all stories have heroes and villains—many are tragic in their ambiguity.

The best immigration journalists become trusted by immigrant communities and simultaneously understand law, economics, and policy deeply enough to hold power accountable. Start there.
