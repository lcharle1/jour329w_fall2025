# A Guide to Immigration Reporting: Stories, Stakes, and Frontiers

Immigration is one of the most consequential, contested, and misunderstood policy domains in American public life right now. Early in your career, it's worth understanding the landscape not as a settled issue, but as an ongoing collision between law, commerce, politics, and human survival. The stories in this collection show why.

## The Current Moment: Enforcement, Uncertainty, Uncertainty

The Trump administration's second term has created a new urgency around immigration enforcement. Unlike abstract policy debates, immigration now touches nearly every institution—from restaurants to detention centers to courtrooms. What makes this moment distinctive is the *speed* and *scope* of enforcement, combined with legal uncertainty about what happens next.

The most visible trend: federal agents are conducting worksite raids with minimal warning. [In May 2025, Department of Homeland Security agents visited more than 100 businesses in the Washington D.C. area](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/15/dc-area-food-industry-shaken-after-dhs-visits-more-than-100-businesses/), including popular restaurants like Pupatella, serving notices requesting employee records. Critically, these were unannounced. As immigration attorney Abel Nuñez noted, this marks a departure from previous practice—historically, ICE has given businesses advance notice via mail. The speed creates real danger: workers now have three days to produce documents, creating opportunities for people to be identified and arrested before they can move.

The broader context matters. These raids are part of a stated goal to deport 1 million people annually. But [actual deportation numbers have lagged behind arrests](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/03/11/trumps-immigration-arrests-and-deportations-by-the-numbers/). In February 2025, ICE made roughly 13,000 book-ins (detentions), but actual removals have fallen short—the administration arrested around 23,000 people in February but deported only 18,000. This gap matters for your reporting: it suggests possible bottlenecks in the system, or questions about who is being detained and why.

## The Unfinished Story: Birthright Citizenship and the Courts

One of the most significant unresolved stories centers on birthright citizenship. [On January 20, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order attempting to restrict birthright citizenship](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/01/21/maryland-joins-fight-against-trumps-order-to-end-birthright-citizenship/). Within days, multiple cases reached court, and [in May 2025, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in Trump v. CASA](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/19/nine-people-stand-between-her-child-and-citizenship-its-a-fight-she-cant-afford-to-lose/), consolidated with other birthright citizenship challenges.

This case remains **actively litigated and unresolved**. The Court could rule at any time. For a pregnant woman named Meny featured in one case, the uncertainty is paralyzing—she's due to give birth while the fate of her child's citizenship hangs in the hands of nine judges. The constitutional question is clear (the 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to those born in the US), but the administration's legal theory—that children born to undocumented parents lack "jurisdiction"—could upend that.

**Story angle:** What happens to children born during litigation? How are hospitals handling birth certificates? Are immigrant families delaying births or planning for worst-case scenarios? This is an unfinished legal story with real-time human consequences.

## Key Institutions and People to Understand

**CASA and ASAP**: These advocacy organizations appear repeatedly in this collection because they're doing frontline legal work. CASA de Maryland is the largest immigrant advocacy group in the Mid-Atlantic, with deep community connections. The Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project (ASAP) focuses on asylum seekers specifically. Both are reliable sources and often have clients willing to go on record.

**Maryland Senators**: Chris Van Hollen has emerged as a particularly vocal Democratic voice on immigration. He's traveled to El Salvador to visit wrongfully deported residents, held press conferences with families, and introduced legislation to force accountability. Ben Cardin is similarly engaged. These aren't just politicians—they're sometimes the only government officials willing to push back against federal actions.

**The Courts**: Multiple cases are pending. Beyond birthright citizenship, the [Supreme Court has reviewed visa denial cases](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/04/23/justices-consider-case-involving-visa-denied-to-husband-of-u-s-citizen/), immigration enforcement policies, and DACA (though DACA currently has more stable legal footing than it did in 2017-2019). Federal judges in Maryland, particularly in Greenbelt, have been issuing consequential rulings on deportation cases.

**Immigrant-serving organizations**: The Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, the International Rescue Committee, the Amica Center, and others provide legal representation, housing, and services. They're also watching enforcement patterns and can talk about how policy shifts affect their caseloads.

## The Delmarva Peninsula: A Canary in the Coal Mine

One particularly important geographic story involves the Delmarva Peninsula (parts of Maryland, Delaware, and Virginia), home to major seafood processing industries and poultry plants. [In February 2025, fear of ICE raids caused the region's streets to empty](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/02/13/fearing-ice-raids-delmarva-immigrants-mostly-stay-home/). Workers stopped going to restaurants, stores, and sometimes jobs—not because raids had occurred, but because of rumors and Trump administration rhetoric.

This matters economically and socially. The region's industries depend on immigrant workers. When workers stay home, businesses suffer immediately. But there's a longer story here about how *anticipatory fear* affects communities—how policy announcements, not just implementation, reshape behavior.

**Story angles**: What happens to poultry processing if workers don't show up? How are rural hospitals and schools dealing with immigrant families' fear of seeking services? Are there documented cases of wage theft or unsafe conditions that employers have gotten away with because workers are now too scared to report?

## The Wrongful Deportation of Kilmar Abrego García: Accountability Stalled

This story, still developing, illustrates the gap between court orders and executive compliance. Kilmar Abrego García, a Maryland resident with legal protections, was deported to El Salvador in March 2025. [Multiple courts, including the Supreme Court in a 9-0 decision, ordered his return](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/04/10/lawmakers-join-wife-of-mistakenly-deported-maryland-man-to-demand-his-return/). Yet as of May 2025, [he remains in an El Salvadoran prison, and the Trump administration has refused to bring him back](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/01/van-hollen-and-fellow-democrats-plan-senate-vote-on-trump-deportation-policy/).

The administration has claimed Abrego García is MS-13 affiliated—a claim without evidence. Courts have found no basis for it. Yet he sits in CECOT, [a notorious mega-prison where he was "traumatized" according to Van Hollen's visit](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/04/18/returning-from-el-salvador-van-hollen-says-we-need-to-bring-mr-abrego-garcia-home/). 

This story remains **unresolved**. The administration is under pressure from courts; Congress is considering legislation; El Salvador's government is complicit. 

**Story angles**: 
- Has there been any movement toward his return? 
- What is the total number of wrongfully deported US residents or legal permanent residents? 
- Are there other cases like his that haven't received congressional attention?
- What leverage, if any, does the US have over El Salvador to compel Abrego García's return?

## Legislative Efforts: State-Level Immigration Policy

Maryland has become a testing ground for state-level immigration protections. [Three bills collectively called the Immigrant Justice Protection Package moved through the legislature in early 2025](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/04/01/legislation-seeks-to-protect-maryland-immigrants-from-trumps-deportation-push/):

1. **Protecting Sensitive Locations Act**: Restricts ICE access to schools, courts, hospitals, and places of worship.
2. **Data Privacy Act**: Blocks ICE from accessing state databases without a warrant.
3. **Maryland Values Act**: Targets 287(g) agreements (local police deputized as immigration agents).

These bills face real opposition from sheriffs in counties with 287(g) agreements (Cecil, Frederick, Harford). The tension is real: sheriffs argue they need to share information with ICE for public safety; immigrant advocates argue this breaks trust with communities and enables racial profiling.

**Story angle**: Have any of these bills passed? If so, what's their actual impact? If not, why? What counties have 287(g) agreements, and what's their stated rationale? Have there been documented cases of abuse?

## The Unaccompanied Minors Crisis: Legal Representation Disappearing

The Trump administration ended federal funding for legal representation of unaccompanied immigrant children. [This creates an immediate crisis in Maryland, which has received more unaccompanied minors per capita than almost any other state](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/03/28/loss-of-federal-funds-for-legal-representation-of-migrant-children-carries-disproportionate-impacts-in-maryland/).

Without lawyers, children miss hearings and receive deportation orders by default. Legal aid groups can't train volunteer attorneys. The Amica Center and others are scrambling, but the math is brutal: thousands of children, hundreds of thousands in legal fees, no federal funding.

**Story angle**: What happens to the backlog of cases? How many children will be deported without representation? Are there documented cases of children disappearing after losing legal support? Can nonprofits bridge the funding gap?

## Labor and Wages: The Informal Economy

Beyond enforcement and law, there's an important economic story. [Day laborers in places like Langley Park routinely accept wages below minimum wage, sometimes as low as $5/hour, because oversupply of workers creates competition](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/02/13/fearing-ice-raids-delmarva-immigrants-mostly-stay-home/). CASA runs a "welcome center" with a wage floor of $10/hour, but many workers avoid it, preferring the higher probability of work at lower wages in informal markets.

This connects to a broader finding: when immigrant workers accept lower wages, it can depress wages for all low-skilled workers. But it also shows resilience—immigrants are making rational economic calculations in impossible situations.

**Story angle**: Post-enforcement, how have day labor wages changed? Are there documented cases of wage theft increasing because workers are too afraid to report? How effective are CASA's efforts?

## Visa Programs and Agricultural Labor

The H-2B visa program (temporary nonagricultural workers) appears repeatedly. [The seafood industry depends on it](https://cnsmaryland.org/2022/11/04/maryland-seafood-industry-to-get-help-with-temporary-worker-visas/). When the program is capped or unavailable, processors lose workers and can't operate. But the program is also vulnerable to exploitation—workers live in employer-provided housing, have limited English, and face threats of deportation.

Similarly, H-2A visas (agricultural workers) create their own dynamics. These programs create quasi-feudal labor relationships where employers hold enormous power.

**Story angle**: How many H-2B visas has the Trump administration approved in 2025? Are there documented cases of abuse in the program? What would happen if the program were eliminated?

## Untold Stories and Underreported Angles

Based on this collection, here are story ideas with real legs:

### 1. **Chinese Students and Visa Revocations**
The collection mentions [visa revocations affecting Chinese exchange students](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/06/caught-in-the-crossfire-chinese-students-navigate-us-china-tensions/) but provides limited detail. This is a growth area: US-China tensions are creating a climate where Chinese students fear their visas will be revoked mid-semester. What's the actual scale? Are there documented cases? What happens to students who suddenly lose visa status while enrolled?

### 2. **Sanctuary City Implementation**
Maryland has sanctuary city policies, but how are they actually working? [Are police complying with the limits?](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/02/20/state-may-block-trump-administration-from-maryland-databases/) Are there cases where sanctuary policies have protected people? Where have they failed?

### 3. **Immigration Court Backlogs**
The collection mentions [backlogs of over 50,000 cases in Maryland alone](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/03/28/loss-of-federal-funds-for-legal-representation-of-migrant-children-carries-disproportionate-impacts-in-maryland/). But what's the human cost? How long do people wait? What happens if you miss a hearing? How are judges handling the volume?

### 4. **TPS and DED Programs**
Temporary Protected Status and Deferred Enforced Departure allow people from certain countries to live legally in the US. But these programs expire or face termination regularly. [The Afghan Adjustment Act would create permanent status](https://cnsmaryland.org/2023/11/30/congress-again-attempting-to-address-afghan-refugee-status/), but it's stalled. How many people are in limbo under TPS/DED? What happens when their status expires?

### 5. **Private Prison Detention**
Counties like Howard make millions housing ICE detainees. [Activists want these contracts to end](https://cnsmaryland.org/2021/02/10/ice-detention-centers-could-leave-maryland-for-good/), but counties argue the revenue funds public safety. What's the actual fiscal impact? Are there alternatives? What do detainees report about conditions?

### 6. **Deportations of US Citizens or Legal Residents**
The Abrego García case isn't isolated. How many US citizens or legal permanent residents have been wrongfully deported? What's the process for getting them back? Are there patterns?

### 7. **Employment-Based Immigration**
The collection mentions H-1B visas and the Trump administration's "Buy American, Hire American" executive order. But what's actually happening to employment-based immigration? Are companies still sponsoring workers? Are visa wait times increasing?

### 8. **Affirmative Asylum Cases**
Most immigration coverage focuses on enforcement and deportations. But some people affirmatively *apply* for asylum. What's happening to asylum processing? How long are cases taking? What are success rates?

## The Narrative Arc Going Forward

Immigration policy is moving fast. The birthright citizenship case will resolve. Wrongful deportations may or may not be remedied. State-level protections may hold or be challenged. Labor markets will adjust (or not) to enforcement. 

Your job as a reporter is to move beyond the horse-race narratives ("Trump vows mass deportations") and into the consequences. Who's actually being deported? What happens to their families? Where are the bottlenecks? Who profits? Who resists? What's the ground truth in communities where this is happening?

The best immigration journalism humanizes without sentimentalizing, reports policy rigorously, and follows the money. It also follows the law—court orders matter, even when they're ignored. And it pays attention to who has power and who doesn't.
