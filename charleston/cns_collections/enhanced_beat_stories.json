    "summary": "Meny, an immigrant from Latin America, joined a lawsuit against President Trump\u2019s executive order that aimed to restrict birthright citizenship, putting her unborn child\u2019s citizenship at risk. The case, CASA v.",
    "content": "This was the news Meny was dreading. It spilled out from the car radio, flooding her drive to work with the question that threatened to overwhelm her: What comes next? Heart racing and anxiety spiking, she sought comfort from the one person who always had a brighter view on things. She called her husband. The couple, immigrants from Latin America, had been planning on getting their unborn child a passport as soon as possible. Now, her child\u2019s citizenship, something she had imagined was a right enshrined in the Constitution for anyone born in the United States, was in doubt.\nOn Jan. 20, President Donald Trump issued an executive order aiming to restrict birthright citizenship \u2013 a move that would leave Meny\u2019s unborn child stateless.\nA week earlier, Leidy Perez, the policy and communications director at the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, had reached out to Meny asking if she would be willing to join a lawsuit against the Trump administration should it make such a move.\n\u201cI said yes without thinking because I\u2019ve always had the opinion that if a mother doesn\u2019t advocate for her children, then how can we wait for someone else to come and do it?\u201d Meny said.\nNow, that possibility has become a reality.\nThe lawsuit against the Trump Administration\u2019s effort to end birthright citizenship was filed on Jan. 21, one day after Trump\u2019s announcement. The plaintiffs include two nonprofit organizations that focus on assisting immigrants and immigrant communities \u2013 ASAP and CASA \u2013 and five pregnant mothers identified only by their first name, as in the case of Meny, or by an alias. Meny herself joined the lawsuit under ASAP, with her personal experience shared in the organization\u2019s formal written statement submitted to the court. The case goes by the name CASA v. Trump.\n\u201cI\u2019m afraid of what might happen because nothing is certain right now,\u201d Meny said. \u201cBut I feel like I\u2019m on the path, moving forward, and this gives one hope.\u201d\nA federal judge granted respite from the uncertainty in February when she granted an injunction, indefinitely blocking President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order to restrict birthright citizenship. A month later, the U.S. government asked the Supreme Court for a partial stay on the pause.\nThe Supreme Court heard oral arguments for Trump v. Casa, which consists of the original case consolidated with two other birthright citizenship lawsuits, on May 15. The Department of Justice did not respond for comment before publication.\nOnce again, Meny found the fate of her unborn child uncertain \u2013 left in the hands of nine judges.\nThe administration has left Meny, who is due in July, \u201cstuck with one foot here and the other foot there,\u201d she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to know what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d Meny said, \u201cEven in our case, I feel we\u2019re a little more protected by the fact that we have social security and a work permit. However, that doesn\u2019t assure us that nothing will happen.\u201d\nA protective veil shrouds Meny\u2019s life from public view. There are some details that are safe to share. A California resident, Meny and her husband are both educators for people with disabilities.\nTheir 8-year-old son\u2019s autism diagnosis played a big role their decision to work with people with disabilities, with Meny saying through her representatives that she \u201chas heard so many bad stories of people with disabilities not being treated well, that she feels a passion for her job and knowing that at least for the eight hours each day that she works, her clients, and her husband\u2019s, can feel safe and loved.\u201d\nBoth she and her partner have open asylum applications pending at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services after they fled from Honduras.\u00a0 Meny\u2019s legal counsel asked Capital News Service not to include questions about her immigration case as a part of the interview for her safety.\nBut Meny did share that she came to the United States more by need than by choice.\n\u201cWe all migrate out of necessity. I don\u2019t believe that anybody does it just to see what happens or just to live the experience,\u201d Meny said. \u201cI believe that we all have a very important reason to migrate, to leave everything behind, to risk our families, like, in my case, myself, my husband and my boy. And, yes, really, yes, it\u2019s very scary to be at a border.\u201d\nShe took a breath, apologizing for her shaking voice before starting again.\n\u201cBut it is very hard and very scary. Not knowing what\u2019s going to happen. The hardest part is the understanding and the tolerance that many people don\u2019t have toward us. For me, that\u2019s the most complicated part of this, aside from the fear of not knowing what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow,\u201d Meny said. \u201cLaws are constantly changing, policies change, so our position changes every day.\u201d\nAgain, Meny said, part of that fear was the intolerance she experienced as an immigrant.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s intensified even more now because people now feel more entitled to mistreat us, criticize us, and insult us. Psychologically, mentally, it\u2019s also a burden we have to fight every day.\u201d\nShe is joined by several other mothers in this case, all with their own veils.\nGeorgina, a Maryland resident, was two months pregnant when the lawsuit was filed. Originally from El Salvador, she has been in the U.S. for six years and is a single mother with limited financial resources. The lawsuit states that Georgina fears that if her child isn\u2019t granted U.S. citizenship and its benefits, she won\u2019t be able to support the baby. She is also afraid her child will be subject to discrimination \u201cbecause she has seen how noncitizens are treated poorly in this country.\u201d\nNiurka, a Florida resident, was due in March. She and her partner are from Cuba and crossed the Mexico-U.S. border. They were placed in deportation proceedings before the U.S. immigration courts. They now have a pending asylum application and a pending lawful permanent residency application under the Cuban Adjustment Act. While in Cuba, she was a medical doctor and her partner was a biopharmaicist.\nThe lawsuit states Niurka and her partner have \u201cno intention of ever going back to Cuba because of the dictatorship, would never want their child to be a Cuban citizen, and do not want their child to ever have to set foot in Cuba.\u201d In the case he is denied U.S. citizenship, they are concerned their son wouldn\u2019t have citizenship from any country.\nLesly, who lives in New Jersey, was due in July. Using an app developed by the U.S. Customs and Border Protections for a wide variety of purposes, including scheduling appointments for asylum processing at the border \u2013 Lesly crossed the border and applied for asylum. Her next hearing is 2028.\nThe stress has begun to build on all these women. Lesly is unsure if she will have to start a U.S. immigration process for her unborn child, and hiring an immigration attorney could cost a lot of money.\nThe list of these women and their stories go on. All of them use their first name or an alias to protect their identity and their families.\nIs Meny worried her identity will become public because she is part of the lawsuit pending before the Supreme Court of the United States?\n\u201cI\u2019ve never been afraid of that. On the contrary,\u201d she said. \u201cI think knowing who I am and putting myself out there and having someone know who I am \u2013 what my name is, where I come from, what happened \u2013 I feel that it is important.\u201d\nHowever, ASAP asked Capital News Service not to reveal details of Meny\u2019s immigration case on the basis that if one of the women\u2019s full names was made public, the government could challenge everyone else\u2019s anonymity.\nThere were no guarantees for her with this court case. Meny doesn\u2019t have a backup plan on if the limitations on birthright citizenship come to pass. She does know, however, that whatever she has to endure, even with the fear that comes with it, she will remain here.\n\u201cThat fear is what gives you strength,\u201d Meny said.\nAndrea Dur\u00e1n contributed to this story.",

    "summary": "Department of Homeland Security agents visited over 100 businesses, including several popular restaurants, in the Washington D.C. area to ensure compliance with U.S.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Department of Homeland Security agents visited more than 100 businesses in the Washington area last week, including nearly a dozen popular restaurants, leaving owners and staff on edge.\n\u201cFor the community as a whole, throughout the entire D.C. and DMV region, it\u2019s an unnerving time\u2026for the industry as a collective,\u201d said Natasha Neely, vice president of Pupatella, one of the restaurants targeted by DHS.\nThe DHS confirmed the agents\u2019 visits in a statement: \u201cU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Investigations is conducting worksite enforcement actions across the nation to ensure businesses are following U.S. immigration and employment laws.\n\u201cThis includes recent worksite enforcement operations (in) the D.C. area, during which more than 100 Notice of Inspections were served to local employers at various business(es). No arrests were made as part of these worksite enforcement operations.\u201d\nNeely told Capital News Service that DHS agents unexpectedly visited both Pupatella locations on Tuesday, May 6, inquiring about I-9 forms, which are documents used to verify employees\u2019 eligibility to work in the United States.\nAt the restaurant\u2019s Dupont location, agents met the general manager outside, identified themselves and asked about the I-9s. When the agents failed to present a warrant, the manager followed company protocol and referred them to the corporate office.\nA few hours later, agents arrived at Pupatella\u2019s Capitol Hill location, where the manager had already been alerted by Neely. Though they still did not have a signed warrant, the agents presented a four-page Notice of Inspection stating they were conducting a standard I-9 audit. The notice stated that agents would return the following week and included a list of suggestions for compliance, Neely said.\nThe notice, which used nearly identical language across businesses, also required owners to hand over the employee records to DHS within three days, according to Abel Nu\u00f1ez, the executive director of the Central American Resource Center, a nonprofit that provides legal aid to the Latino community in the Washington area.\n\u201c(DHS) seems to be going to what I would call D.C. staples that everyone knows,\u201d Neely said. \u201cThings that D.C. is known for\u2014that the community gets behind, that started out in this region\u2014and then it expanded beyond that.\u201d\nIn addition to Pupatella, DHS visited Millie\u2019s, Chef Geoff\u2019s, Chang Chang, Ghostburger, Officina, Jaleo, Call Your Mother, Clyde\u2019s, Cynthia, Santa Rosa Taqueria and others, according to reports by The Washingtonian and Eater DC.\nAs of Wednesday, no arrests had been confirmed, and no agents had returned to Pupatella.\nStill, workers at bars and restaurants across the city remain on high alert. Representatives from four restaurants said Wednesday that they had lost employees, either permanently or temporarily, since the DHS visits, according to a report by The Washington Post.\nThe two-day sweep began a few days after warnings started circulating online about possible immigration enforcement action targeting restaurants and food delivery drivers in Washington.\n\u201cIt was very much a blindside\u2014aside from the rumor mill\u2026there was nothing directly to us as a company,\u201d Neely said. \u201cNothing that had been confirmed or was substantial. Nothing. We did not receive any form of notification.\u201d\nNu\u00f1ez told CNS that the short timeline puts restaurant workers without legal status at risk, even when they\u2019re not on the job.\n\u201cThe addresses (on I-9s) are probably pretty current, so that\u2019s a way of identifying where they live, and then just going to pick them up. I doubt that people can move in three days,\u201d he said.\nWorkers who may have provided false information on their I-9s face heightened legal risks, Nu\u00f1ez added. In such cases, DHS could consider that probable cause for arrest and pursue additional charges like identity theft or falsifying federal documents \u2014 and the employers who knowingly hired them could also face steep fines.\nWashington Mayor Muriel Bowser condemned the visits and said that the Metropolitan Police Department was not involved.\n\u201cI have heard those reports. I\u2019ve been getting them all morning. I am disturbed by them,\u201d she told reporters on May 6. \u201cIt appears as though ICE is at restaurants or even in neighborhoods \u2014 and it doesn\u2019t look like they\u2019re targeting criminals, and it does look like they\u2019re disrupting.\u201d\nDHS\u2019s actions in Washington are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to annually deport\u00a01 million immigrants.\nAlthough I-9 audits have occurred under previous administrations, Nu\u00f1ez said that the unannounced DHS visits indicated a \u201cclear attempt to intimidate owners\u201d and marked a departure from standard practice.\n\u201cThis is not a new thing. I-9 audits are embedded in the law. Biden did it. Obama did it,\u201d Nu\u00f1ez said. \u201cBut usually it\u2019s a letter sent to you via mail telling (your business) that ICE will conduct a raid within a couple of weeks, so they give you time to prepare. They usually do not get delivered by hand.\u201d\nNeely said Pupatella is working to support staff across its locations and ensure they understand their rights in the event of future audits or raids.\nImmigration advocates stressed that all workers, regardless of legal status, have the right to remain silent, speak to an attorney if detained and refuse to sign any documents.\n\u201cD.C. residents and D.C. workers have rights in this country, regardless of their immigration status,\u201d UNITE HERE Local 25, a union representing hospitality workers in the Washington area, said in a statement to CNS. \u201cThe vilification and dehumanization of immigrants and erosion of rights, including due process\u2026, is a direct threat to the rights of all working people.\u201d\nNu\u00f1ez warned that mass deportations among restaurant workers could have lasting, devastating effects on the greater Washington area.\n\u201cThis will have ripple effects at an individual level, at a family level, but also at a city level,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re all integrated\u2014when one of us doesn\u2019t have the ability to work well, it impacts everybody else.\u201d",

The privileged bill forces a Senate vote, with potential consequences for El Salvador's security assistance if reports are insufficient or not provided.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Senate Democrats, including Maryland\u2019s Chris Van Hollen, introduced legislation Thursday that would require the Trump administration to report how it is complying with court orders regarding the wrongful deportation of U.S. citizens and residents to El Salvador.\nThe legislation, sponsored by Van Hollen, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, and Sens. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Alex Padilla of California, also would make the administration confirm the use of American security assistance to support the detention of U.S. residents and assess El Salvador\u2019s human rights record.\n\u201cIf you think you can take steps like this without Congress challenging your executive overreach, you\u2019re wrong,\u201d Kaine said at a press conference outside the United States Capitol. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll also send a message to the government of El Salvador, you might think it\u2019s cute right now to grab attention by a bromance with President Trump, \u2026 and if you think we\u2019ll forget you violating the human rights of American citizens, you\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\u201cWe will remember this forever, and there will be significant and challenging downstream consequences for any nation that violates the rights of Americans,\u201d Kaine said.\nThe legislation is \u201cprivileged,\u201d which means the Senate will be forced to vote on the measure, giving Republicans an opportunity to publicly express their views on Trump\u2019s deportation process. The timing of the vote will be negotiated between Schumer and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-South Dakota.\nUnder the legislation, if the administration fails to produce the report, security assistance to El Salvador would be illegal under federal law. If a submitted report was insufficient, the Senate could file additional privileged legislation to terminate security assistance, Kaine said.\nThe senators\u2019 move comes in the wake of the wrongful deportation of Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\nA federal judge, an appeals court and the Supreme Court all ordered the administration, which admitted in court last month that the deportation was an error, to facilitate Abrego Garcia\u2019s return. But Trump has refused to do so, even after claiming he had the power to in an interview with ABC News Tuesday.\n\u201cIf he were the gentleman that you say he is, I would do that. But he is not,\u201d Trump said. The president and his administration have claimed Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang to justify his deportation.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not vouching for Kilmar Abrego Garcia,\u201d Van Hollen said Thursday. \u201cWe are vouching for his constitutional rights, because if you trample over his constitutional rights, you threaten them for every American and everyone who resides in America.\u201d\nVan Hollen is the only person outside of El Salvador to speak with Abrego Garcia since his deportation, the senator said. During his time in the country, Van Hollen said he also met with multiple human rights groups, who described mistreatment in prisons by El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele.\nThe Department of State\u2019s 2023 human rights report on the country found there were credible reports of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment in its prisons.\nThe United States plans to compensate El Salvador $15 million to house deported residents and has already paid the country roughly $4 million, Van Hollen confirmed.\n\u201cOur pitch to our colleagues would be, \u2018Why wouldn\u2019t you want a human rights report?\u2019\u201d Kaine said. \u201cIf Americans are being sent there, you would want a human rights report about the conditions. So, we have high hopes that we\u2019ll be able to get it passed.\u201d",

Authorities placed him in a cell with around 25 others at CECOT, the country\u2019s most notorious prison.\nMaryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen shared those details and others after returning from El Salvador Friday, hours after President Donald Trump publicly called him a \u201ca fake\u201d for visiting. The senator spoke alongside the members of the Maryland Legislative Latino Caucus and Abrego Garc\u00eda\u2019s family \u2014 including his wife, brother and mother \u2014 at Washington Dulles International Airport shortly after his flight landed.\n\u201cAs the federal courts have said, we need to bring Mr. Abrego Garcia home to protect his constitutional rights to due process,\u201d Van Hollen said. \u201cThis is a case about upholding the constitutional rights for Mr. Abrego Garc\u00eda and every American.\u201d\nAfter arriving in El Salvador on Wednesday, Van Hollen said he initially was denied his requests of the Salvadoran government to meet Abrego Garc\u00eda to confirm his well-being. It wasn\u2019t until Van Hollen was about to fly back to the United States that he received word that he was allowed to meet with Abrego Garc\u00eda in the hotel where the senator was staying in San Salvador.\n\u201cWell, I think the reason they relented, it\u2019s pretty clear they were feeling the pressure,\u201d Van Hollen said. \u201cI think that they decided that it was not a good look to continue to detain Abrego Garc\u00eda without anybody having access to him. There\u2019s no other explanation for the fact that they said no.\u201d\nPart of that pressure, Van Hollen said, may have been prompted by his mention of a possible violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights during one of two press conferences he held in El Salvador with local media. The covenant, created by the United Nations in 1966, requires governments to allow detainees access to a lawyer or legal counsel.\n\u201cIt could have been a factor, because they are in blatant violation of that requirement, that international law requirement, not only in this case, but actually in all of these cases,\u201d he said as the caucus behind him clapped in agreement.\nDuring the meeting, which made Abrego Garc\u00eda one of very few prisoners to make it out of CECOT, he told the senator he was \u201ctraumatized\u201d after spending weeks in the mega-prison, but since has been transferred to a prison in Santa Ana, which Van Hollen said is \u201cpretty far outside\u201d San Salvador.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cHe was not afraid of the other prisoners in his immediate cells, but that he was traumatized by being at CECOT,\u201d Van Hollen said. \u201c(He was) fearful of many of the prisoners in other cell blocks who called out to him and taunted him in various ways.\u201d\u00a0\nOver coffee, water and margaritas, which Van Hollen said neither he nor Abrego Garc\u00eda drank, the two discussed Abrego Garc\u00eda\u2019s time in the country. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele previously mocked them on X for being in \u201ctropical paradise.\u201d Van Hollen said the Salvadoran government staged the \u201cmargarita-gate,\u201d noting that two government officials came over and placed two glasses with salt or sugar on the rim in front of them.\nMaryland Sen.

You would see a gap. There\u2019s no gap. Nobody drank any margaritas or sugar water or whatever it was.\u201d\nAlthough Van Hollen got the answers he was searching for about Abrego Garc\u00eda\u2019s health and well-being, the Trump administration has given no indication it will bring him back home.\u00a0\nVan Hollen said he understands the administration has an agreement to pay El Salvador $15 million to detain prisoners.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether there is an agreement that specifically spells out the terms and conditions here. I am aware that there was some document that memorialized the payments,\u201d Van Hollen said, calling the payments unauthorized because they didn\u2019t go through the congressional appropriations process.\nMaryland Sen.

Reading from a piece of paper, the president said: \u201cHe\u2019s an illegal alien, MS-13 gang member, and foreign terrorist.\u201d\nThe administration is under pressure from the courts to return Abrego Garc\u00eda.\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit on Thursday rejected the Trump administration\u2019s effort to stop a lower court\u2019s order that government officials must be questioned about the deportation of Abrego Garc\u00eda. The three-judge panel wrote that the government\u2019s position \u201cshould be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear.\u201d\nIn a call-out to El Salvador, Van Hollen ridiculed the government and President Nayib Bukele for branding the country as a place for mega-prisons where people are being \u201cillegally abducted.\u201d He noted that the country had once focused its branding on technology and Bitcoin but was now gaining a new reputation.\nJust as the press conference began, it ended with chants from the caucus: \u201cS\u00ed se puede, s\u00ed se puede,\u201d as supporters held bright orange signs reading, \u201cThank you Senator Van Hollen.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Lawmakers, legal experts and advocates are continuing the fight to push for the return of Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garc\u00eda, who was mistakenly deported to CECOT, El Salvador\u2019s most notorious prison, and has not been heard from for over a month.\nMaryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Democrat, traveled to El Salvador Wednesday, where he attempted to visit Abrego Garc\u00eda and hold talks with government officials to push for his release and check on his well-being, a promise he made to the man\u2019s family during a press conference in Washington last week.\n\u201cI promised them that I would do everything I could to get him out of CECOT,\u201d Van Hollen said during a press conference in El Salvador. \u201cAnd I won\u2019t stop trying, and I can assure the president, the vice president, that I may be the first United States senator to visit El Salvador on this issue, but there will be more and there will be more members of Congress coming.\u201d\nVan Hollen said he asked the country\u2019s vice president whether any government had any evidence linking Abrego Garc\u00eda to MS-13.\n\u00a0\u201cThey do not,\u201d Van Hollen said, questioning why Garc\u00eda is still being held at CECOT.\u00a0\nEl Salvador Vice President F\u00e9lix Ulloa told the senator he could not visit Abrego Garc\u00eda and that he needed more time. When Van Hollen asked if a visit could happen next week, F\u00e9lix Ulloa said he couldn\u2019t promise that either.\u00a0\nA phone or video call requested to check on Abrego Garc\u00eda\u2019s health and connect him with his family, so they could hear his voice, was also denied. The only possibility granted, Van Hollen said, was that \u201cmaybe\u201d something could be arranged through the U.S. embassy.\nA couple of hours earlier, Maryland Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin blistered the Trump administration for rebuffing appeals to get Abrego Garc\u00eda returned.\u00a0\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, tells reporters Wednesday that it is \u201cabsurd\u201d that the Trump administration claims it can do nothing to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia from an El Salvador prison. (Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)\n\u201cThe claim that there\u2019s nothing the U.S. government can do is absurd,\u201d Raskin said during a press call-in with legal experts and immigration advocates. \u201cThe reason why Mr. Abrego Garc\u00eda is in El Salvador is because of an agreement between the U.S. government and the Salvadoran government whereby we\u2019re paying them $6 million for the purpose of holding people that we deport or render to El Salvador. They are very clearly, in a legal sense, our agent in this entire affair.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Supreme Court ruled on April 7 that the Trump Administration must facilitate Abrego Garc\u00eda\u2019s return, but by Monday, El Salvador\u2019s President Nayib Bukele said he could not and would not return him. In a Monday Oval Office meeting, President Donald Trump and Bukele shared the same stance, both stating they would not bring Abrego Garc\u00eda back to the United States. Trump also said he was powerless to free Garc\u00eda.\n\u201cFrom the day Donald Trump descended the escalator in Trump Plaza in 2015 to announce his candidacy for president, he has put a target on the backs of immigrants,\u201d said Vanessa C\u00e1rdenas, the executive director of America\u2019s Voice, an immigration reform organization, during the call-in. \u201cWhat we saw this week from the White House should shake every American who cares about the rule of law in our democracy.\u201d\nAlso on Wednesday, District Judge James E. Boasberg in Washington threatened to open a contempt inquiry into the administration, calling its actions \u2018willful disregard\u2019 in the context of temporarily halting deportations. Boasberg said he found probable cause to hold the administration in contempt over broader issues with deportation flights.\u00a0\nAttorney General Pam Bondi on Wednesday was adamant about doing nothing to help Abrego Garcia.\n\u201cPresident Bukele said he was not sending him back. That\u2019s the end of the story,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cIf he wanted to send him back, we would give him a plane ride back. There was no situation, ever, where he was going to stay in this country. None.\u201d\nDuring a Fox News appearance on Monday, Bondi said Abrego Garc\u00eda was \u201cnot a Maryland man,\u201d further denying his status as a legally protected immigrant and echoing the claims of Bukele, calling him a terrorist and an MS-13 gang member.\n\u201cThe hypocrisy of now taking the rhetoric that \u2018we made a mistake\u2019 to \u2018he\u2019s a terrorist\u2019 is nothing more than a bald-faced lie,\u201d David Leopold, America\u2019s Voice\u2019s legal advisor and the chair of immigration practice at UB Greensfelder, a law firm in Washington, said in the call-in.\nLeopold said that Abrego Garc\u00eda was granted lawful status in 2019 to live and work in the United States by the Immigration Court under the Department of Justice when Trump was president.\n\u201cThey (the immigration court) go through background, they go through criminal history, they go through a whole array of checks to make sure the individual that they are allowing to stay in the United States is acceptable and is not in any way going to be a community threat. And that\u2019s what happened here,\u201d Leopold said.\nRaskin said that Abrego Garc\u00eda, who has no criminal record, has won his case at every level of the court system, including in the Supreme Court.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing that there\u2019s a nine-zero decision from the Supreme Court, which was very much created in Trump\u2019s own image, telling him that he must comply with the due process imperative of the Constitution,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cHe should not be in a position of thumbing his nose at the U.S. Supreme Court, which he had bragged about so many times.\u201d\nRaskin suggested history is repeating itself.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019re living in a time very much like the Alien and Sedition Acts of the 1790s,\u201d Raskin said, which were laws aimed at restricting free speech and the rights of immigrants. \u201cThere are principles very much at the heart of this struggle right now, and that\u2019s the essential message that we need to get through to the country.\u201d\n\nKilmar Abrego Garc\u00eda: A Timeline\n\n\n\nMarch 28, 2019: Abrego Garc\u00eda was arrested and ICE took him into federal immigration detention.\nApril 24, 2019: Abrego Garc\u00eda was taken to a removal hearing before an immigration judge. His attorney applied for his release on bail, but ICE opposed the application, arguing that local police had identified him as a \u201cverified\u201d active gang member and was therefore a threat to the community.\nOctober 2019: Judge David M. Jones granted Abrego Garc\u00eda\u2019s request for \u201cwithholding of removal\u201d based on his fear of persecution by the aforementioned gang. The government did not appeal, so Jones\u2019s ruling is now final.\nMarch 12, 2025: Abrego Garc\u00eda was driving with his disabled 5-year-old child and was pulled over by ICE without a warrant.\nMarch 15, 2025: Abrego Garc\u00eda was sent to CECOT, a mega-prison in El Salvador. On the same day, the Trump administration deported 238 Venezuelans to El Salvador as well.\nMarch 24, 2025: Abrego Garc\u00eda\u2019s attorneys filed suit in Greenbelt, Maryland, asking U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis to order him returned.\nApril 9, 2025: Abrego Garc\u00eda\u2019s wife, Jennifer, spoke at a press conference in a Capitol administrative building.\nApril 10, 2025: The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 in a per curiam order that the government facilitate his return.\nApril 16, 2025: Maryland senator Chris Van Hollen lands in El Salvador, hoping to meet with Abrego Garc\u00eda and check in on him.\n\n\n\nTimeline: (Jess Daninhirsch/Capital News Service)\nSource: \u201cAbrego Garcia and MS-13: What Do We Know?\u201d by Lawfare Media",

Following that decision, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis of Maryland directed the administration to bring back Abrego Garcia \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, joined by Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, and Rep. Glenn Ivey, D-Maryland, demanded answers Wednesday about the mistaken deportation of Maryland resident Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\nVan Hollen said a Maryland judge determined there were \u201cno legal grounds whatsoever for his arrest, detention or removal.\u201d He added that the judge found Abrego Garcia\u2019s deportation \u201cwholly lawless\u201d and warned of the dangers he now faces in a maximum-security prison in El Salvador.\n\u201cJD Vance lied through his teeth when he said that Kilmar had been convicted of a crime in the United States. Absolutely false,\u201d Van Hollen said at a Capitol Hill press conference. \u201cThe Vice President should apologize to the family \u2014 and he should do it now.\u201d\nThat concern was echoed by Ivey, who criticized the administration\u2019s inaction to bring Abrego Garcia home.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time for them to put up or shut up. Bring him back, let\u2019s get him in court, have the day in court,\u201d Ivey said. \u201cThey sent him to one of the most notorious prisons in the Western Hemisphere.\u201d\nOn March 15, immigration authorities deported Abrego Garcia to a notorious mega prison in El Salvador, which lawmakers described as \u201cheinous\u201d and known for torturing inmates. Abrego Garcia fled the country at age 16 to escape threats of gang violence, murder and extortion. A U.S. immigration judge granted him legal protection from deportation in 2019, a protection that has since been reversed under the Trump administration.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, stood beside lawmakers and signs reading \u201cBRING KILMAR HOME,\u201d next to a picture of him holding one of his children, with tears in her eyes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been 28 days since I last saw my husband. Since his children hugged him, since his mother has kissed him, since his brother has talked to him,\u201d she said.\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Rep. Adriano Espaillat, D-New York, and chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said at a Capitol Hill press conference Wednesday that he plans to send a letter directly to the president of El Salvador to urge the release of a Maryland man mistakenly sent to a prison in that country. (Giuseppe LoPiccolo/Capital News Service)\nCourts have ruled that his deportation should have never happened, she said, and that her \u201clife partner\u201d should have been home \u201c50 hours ago.\u201d\nShe addressed her husband directly, looking straight into the cameras: \u201cIf you can hear me, I\u2019m still fighting for you \u2014 your brother, your mother, your children. We\u2019re still fighting for you, and we\u2019re not gonna give up hope.\u201d\nRep. Juan Vargas, D-California, thanked Vasquez Sura for her tears, saying her words and emotions cut to the heart of a wider national crisis.\n\u201cYour tears were joined with the tears of many people in my district in San Diego, and they form a stream. And throughout this country, they form a river, a river appears because of what\u2019s happening to families,\u201d Vargas said.\nHe compared Abrego Garcia\u2019s disappearance to his own experiences during the 1980s in El Salvador as a Jesuit, when violence often led to people vanishing without a trace.\n\u201cI never thought that something like that would happen in my own country, where masked people that work for the government would come abduct people off the street,\u201d he said.\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Maryland, echoed that concern, saying the Trump administration is trying to wash its hands of what happens after deportation.\n\u201cThey\u2019re framing us to believe that the U.S. government can pick somebody up off the street, with no due process, ship them to El Salvador \u2014 and that\u2019s the end of our story,\u201d Raskin told reporters after the press conference. \u201cWe can\u2019t accept that.\u201d\nA letter sent Tuesday night by a group of 25 senators, led by Van Hollen, called on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to answer seven specific questions about how DHS handles immigrants with legally protected status. The request follows a Supreme Court decision that temporarily paused a lower court\u2019s order for ICE to return Abrego Garcia to the United States.\nNot all criticism was directed at the Trump administration.\nRep. Adriano Espaillat, D-New York, and chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said he plans to send a letter directly to the Salvadoran government asking for Abrego Garcia\u2019s release ahead of Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele\u2019s upcoming visit to meet with President Donald Trump on April 14.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know his condition, the family deserves to know his condition, and if they don\u2019t tell us, we will visit the prison ourselves to go visit him,\u201d Espaillat said.\nWhen asked if this effort would make a difference, Espaillat responded by saying that hearing Vasquez Sura speak should certainly make a difference in the nation.\n\u201cPublic sentiment in this nation, as Abraham Lincoln said right in the middle of the Civil War, is everything,\u201d Espaillat said. \u201cJennifer\u2019s story could move mountains, not just bring him back home.\u201d\nLawmakers warned that Abrego Garcia\u2019s deportation reveals a pattern of stripping immigrants of not only their legal protections, but their worth. They added that Republican leaders are fueling a narrative that dehumanizes the immigrant community and takes away their due process.\n\u201cYou owe this man\u2019s family answers, and you owe the American people an explanation for why the Constitution seems optional in their own country,\u201d Rep.

    "content": "Three bills, collectively known as Maryland\u2019s Immigrant Justice Protection Package, aimed at protecting the rights of Maryland\u2019s immigrant community are moving through the Maryland General Assembly.\nThe bills will help protect immigrants from the Trump administration\u2019s new deportation push, according to Ninfa Amador of CASA, an advocacy and service organization that works with immigrants and working-class families. \u201cOur focus has shifted to ensure that we are at the front lines against Trump\u2019s mass deportations campaign,\u201d she said in an interview with Capital News Service.\u00a0\nDue to an executive order issued by President Trump, Protecting the American People Against Invasion, federal immigration authorities are able to target immigrants solely on their legal status. \u201cThis goes to the core of our immigrant families, of individuals who have been in this state for decades, who are the main providers for their families,\u201d said Amador.\nWhat does each act do?\u00a0\nThe Protecting Sensitive Locations Act establishes guidelines for ICE\u2019s access to \u201csensitive locations,\u201d including schools, courthouses, hospitals and places of worship.\u00a0\n\u201cThis bill is really working to give our community that vote of confidence that if they take their kids to school, that when they take their toddler to see the pediatrician, that when they go to church, that they are not under the fear and threat of deportation,\u201d said Amador.\u00a0\nDel. Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery), the bill\u2019s sponsor, told CNS \u201cthese residents are our neighbors, our friends, and contribute to the state in countless ways, and it\u2019s important that the state steps up to ensure that we protect our immigrant communities, especially at locations that should be sensitive and sacred.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Data Privacy Act is intended to block federal immigration authorities from obtaining access to local and state agency databases so that immigrant families can access government services without fear that their information will be shared with immigration authorities.\nThe last bill of the package, the Maryland Values Act, targets 287(g) agreements, which allow local enforcement to double as ICE agents, performing and supporting federal immigration enforcement. CASA argued that \u201cthese agreements have been repeatedly abused, enabling racist sheriffs to racially profile and target marginalized communities.\u201d\nAccording to The Washington Post, Cecil, Frederick, Harford, Carroll, Garrett, Washington and St. Mary\u2019s counties currently have formal 287(g) agreements in place and several other counties have informal agreements with ICE.\u00a0\nThe Maryland Values Act recently had a hearing in the Senate and is awaiting a vote in the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee according to Amador. She said that the Sensitive Locations Act and the Maryland Data Privacy Act are awaiting a vote in the House Judiciary Committee. All three bills have about a week to be signed into law before the Maryland General Assembly session ends on April 7th. \nImmigrant mobility and daily life\nThe daily lives of immigrants, regardless of their legal status, has been upended by President Trump\u2019s mass deportation campaign, according to Casa.\u00a0\u00a0\nAmador said that local communities are concerned about ICE enforcement and are taking action to limit possible interactions, including many immigrants not leaving their homes unless absolutely necessary.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is limiting people\u2019s freedom of movement, liberty, and really the national rhetoric is one of fear,\u201d according to Amador.\u00a0\nShe said that families are dealing with the difficult choices of not sending their children to school or not taking their children to get their vaccines for basic health checkups. Faith leaders are experiencing a decrease in their weekly attendance in immigrant communities.\n\u201cCasa and the immigrant community in Maryland is not going to just sit back and hide,\u201d said Amador. Their website also includes a call to action, in which individuals can sign a petition to their state legislators, advocating for these bills to be passed.\u00a0\u00a0\nCASA also plans to continue connecting directly with community members and hosting \u201cknow your rights\u201d clinics. These clinics seek to teach individuals how to exercise their constitutional rights, regardless of legal status.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen people know their rights, they are protected,\u201d said Amador.",

This move adds significant stress to already vulnerable youths who are trying to acclimate to a new country while managing school, work, and trauma recovery.",
    "content": "The Trump administration is moving ahead with plans to end a contract that pays for the legal representation of children navigating immigration court cases after entering the country without parents or guardians.\u00a0\nThat decision could have outsize impacts in Maryland, where a disproportionate share of unaccompanied immigrant children have landed in recent years, often fleeing violence, sexual abuse, and neglect.\nThe state\u2019s nonprofit legal aid groups are now grappling with the prospect of young clients facing the courts alone, raising the risk that children miss hearings, lose connections to service providers, and receive deportation orders.\u00a0\nEstefani Flores Portillo, a social services coordinator with the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, says the loss of funding could also leave more than a thousand clients across Maryland \u2014 most in their teens \u2014 to balance fending for themselves in immigration court with the day-to-day challenges of acclimating to a new country.\n\u201cOutside of their legal case, they also have other priorities,\u201d she said. Most of her clients are enrolled in school, some hold down jobs to cover basic living expenses, and many require therapy to process traumas inflicted both in their home countries and during their journeys to the U.S.\u00a0\nBurdened with those competing pressures, she added, \u201cit would be hard for them to focus on the legal case\u201d without the assistance of an attorney.\nOn March 21, the administration notified nonprofit legal aid groups providing representation for unaccompanied immigrant children that it would terminate the contract that funds their work. Those legal aid groups collectively represent more than 26,000 children with cases before immigration courts across the country, and they provide consultations and referrals to thousands more each year.\nThe withdrawal of federal support for legal representation of immigrant children comes as immigration courts struggle to manage a staggering backlog of cases, including more than 50,000 in Maryland alone as of February 2025.\u00a0\nMaryland has received among the largest numbers of unaccompanied immigrant children in the past decade relative to other states.\u00a0\nData from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) indicates that nearly 40,000 unaccompanied immigrant children have been released to sponsors \u2013 either family members or volunteers \u2013 in Maryland since 2014. A majority of those children arrived after 2020, primarily from Central America.\nOnly Texas, California, Florida and New York received more unaccompanied immigrant children in the same period.\nRoughly 13,000 of those children landed in Prince George\u2019s County alone, though even some corners of rural Maryland have seen hundreds of new arrivals in the past five years.\u00a0\nEven with legal representation, unaccompanied children often spend years awaiting the resolution of their case, both because of the burden on immigration courts and asylum offices and because of the limited number of visas available each year. \n\n\u201cKids don\u2019t want to think about these things longer than they have to,\u201d said Caroline Hodge, a supervising attorney with the Amica Center. The immigration court system is difficult enough for attorneys to navigate, she added, and children hardly stand a chance on their own.\nThough the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act requires HHS to provide legal counsel to all children in its care \u201cto the greatest extent possible,\u201d thousands of children with open immigration cases already lack representation.\u00a0\nThat shortfall is driven in part by a nationwide shortage of immigration attorneys prepared to work with juvenile clients. Until this month, federal dollars also helped nonprofits like the Amica Center train attorneys willing to volunteer their time to represent children in immigration court. The end of the federal contract supporting her organization\u2019s work, Hodge said, also means her team will no longer be able to provide that training.\u00a0\u00a0\nImmigration court data collected by the U.S. Department of Justice between 2004 and 2016 suggests that roughly 60 percent of children with cases in a Maryland immigration court had legal representation during that period. The same data indicates that while nearly all children with attorneys appeared in court for a final decision in their case, only a third of those without attorneys did so.\u00a0\n\u201cThe idea of going to court is so terrifying for a child,\u201d Hodge said, \u201cand people without information, without representation, will definitely feel more fearful to engage.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has already signaled its interest in following through on deportation orders issued for children who fail to appear for immigration court hearings.\nMaryland\u2019s Department of Human Services, which houses the state\u2019s Office for Refugees and Asylees, has so far avoided commenting on the end of federal funding for immigrant children\u2019s legal representation. A department spokesperson referred CNS to its federal counterpart, HHS, for comment, though that agency likewise did not immediately respond to inquiries about the expected outcomes of the decision.\u00a0\nMeanwhile, legal aid groups told Capital News Service that some attorneys fear that continuing to offer pro bono legal assistance to immigrants will make them targets, citing the White House\u2019s recent efforts to punish law firms deemed hostile to the administration.",

    "summary": "President Trump's administration has seen a rise in immigration arrests compared to the previous administration but deportations have fallen below expectations. Despite promises to significantly increase enforcement, data shows that while ICE arrests are up, actual removals are lower than under President Biden.",
    "content": "President Donald Trump\u2019s second term has sparked conversation regarding\u00a0 U.S. immigration policy as his administration pushes to keep Trump\u2019s promise to deport millions of people. Recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) data shows deportations falling below expectations though immigration arrests are significantly higher than under former President Biden.\nDuring his 2024 campaign, President Trump promised to prioritize enforcement against illegal immigration, secure the southern border, and end birthright citizenship. In his inauguration speech, Trump declared, \u201cthe golden age of America begins right now. We will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.\u201d\nAccording to data released by ICE, the agency saw almost 13,000 immigration \u201cbook-ins\u201d in February, up from about 12,000 in January and less than 8,000 in December. A book-in is when a detained individual enters into custody in an immigration detention facility.\u00a0 At the same time, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has seen fewer book-ins as southern border crossings have decreased, according to the U.S. Border Patrol.\u00a0\n\nWhile ICE made 1,179 arrests by Jan. 26, the daily average arrests dropped to around 800 by the end of January and to fewer than 600 during the first two weeks of February. These figures fell far short of Trump officials\u2019 predictions of 1,200 to 1,500 arrests per day though are significantly higher than arrests under Biden, who saw an average of 467 arrests per day in 2023, his largest year for enforcement, The Washington Post said in an article.\nRemovals have not kept up with arrests so far in Trump\u2019s term. According to The New York Times, the Trump administration arrested around 23,000 people in February but deported only about 18,000. Reuters reported that in January Trump deported around 38,000 people, less than Biden\u2019s average of 57,000 removals a month in 2024.\nCountries in Central and South America have historically experienced the most detrimental effects from removals by ICE. Several of these countries have responded to this situation in differing ways.\nAccording to The Associated Press, President Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo said Guatemala will accept migrants from other countries being deported from the U.S. Deportees would be returned to their home countries at U.S. expense. El Salvador, under a U.S. agreement, has agreed to house deported individuals, regardless of nationality.\nIn Mexico, President Claudia Sheinbaum has set up shelters at the border to house returned citizens. Mexico also caused controversy in January when it denied a U.S. military plane carrying returned migrants permission to land.\n\nRemovals in Biden\u2019s administration\nWhile ICE removals saw a significant drop during the COVID-19 pandemic, former President Joe Biden oversaw a dramatic surge in removals during his final years in the oval office.\nDuring Biden\u2019s first full year in FY2021, his administration carried out nearly 60,000 ICE removals. By the end of his presidency, ICE removals had increased over fourfold, with numbers surpassing 270,000 in FY2024.\nOn April 10, 2023, Biden signed into law an act that ended the COVID national emergency, allowing ICE to resume operations that had been halted during the pandemic and carry out more widespread raids and removals.\nFrom 2016 to 2024 \u2013 the start of Trump\u2019s first term until the end of Biden\u2019s administration \u2014 Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador had the highest number of overall ICE removals. El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras experienced dramatic growth in ICE removals from 2021-2024, during Biden\u2019s term, while Mexico experienced minimal growth, according to ICE data.\n\nTrump\u2019s first administration\nTrump\u2019s immigration policies have emphasized enforcement, but his first term saw deportation numbers fluctuating due to shifting priorities during the pandemic.\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, in FY2017, ICE reported around 225,000 removals, down from over 240,000 in the final year of the Obama administration. ICE attributed the decrease to \u201can increased deterrent effect\u201d from previous years\u2019 stronger enforcement efforts.\nDuring Trump\u2019s first term, Mexican citizens were deported at more than four times the rate of the second highest, Guatemala.\n\nIn 2020, the final year of Trump\u2019s first term, ICE removals fell to around 122,000, a significant decrease largely attributed to the pandemic. The Trump administration enforced policy changes in 2020 that prioritized removing individuals who posed public safety threats, rather than conducting widespread raids, aimed at reducing detention center populations to prevent the spread of COVID.\nAs America approaches the third month of Trump\u2019s second administration, immigration enforcement efforts are likely to increase. The Department of Homeland Security is creating a registry for undocumented immigrants to self-report their status which requires individuals who are in the U.S. illegally to provide an address and fingerprints. Those who do not comply could face fines or prosecution, according to a statement released by Homeland Security.",

The bill aims to ensure privacy and transparency, addressing fears in immigrant communities amid increased federal enforcement actions.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS \u2014 Some Maryland lawmakers are seeking to protect residents\u2019 data from law enforcement intrusions amid heightened immigration enforcement by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.\nThe proposed Maryland Data Privacy Act would prohibit police and other local officials from sharing personal information, granting access to databases, or allowing entry into facilities for federal immigration enforcement\u2014unless a valid warrant from a state or federal court is provided.\u00a0\n\u201cThis is a privacy bill to ensure the federal government cannot go through a fishing expedition in our state databases,\u201d said Sen. Clarence Lam, a Democrat representing Howard and Anne Arundel Counties. \u201cThis legislation really is about promoting transparency and promoting privacy. Marylanders have a right to know who\u2019s attempting to access their data.\u201d\nThe bill builds on the 2021 Driver Privacy Act, which limited the sharing of driver\u2019s license information with federal immigration enforcement agencies. It would expand those protections across all state agencies, creating uniformity in how state agencies handle requests.\nThe legislation comes amid a crackdown on illegal immigration by the Trump administration. An executive order in January deployed 1,500 troops to the southern border, in addition to the 2,500 already deployed there. The administration also removed restrictions on where ICE officials can operate, reversing a policy that prohibited ICE arrests at or near schools, places of worship and other protected sites.\u00a0\nThe increased enforcement has sparked fear among immigrant communities, leading to concerns about how state data-sharing practices could impact their safety and willingness to engage with state resources.\n\u201cMany Marylanders are fearful and anxious and scared,\u201d Lam said. \u201cThe immigrant community feels like they are under assault and this bill is important to them.\u201d\nState Comptroller Brooke Lierman emphasized the importance of ensuring immigrants feel safe accessing state resources, noting that they are over 21% of Maryland\u2019s workforce and contribute significantly to the state\u2019s economy.\n\u201cWe want to encourage compliance with our tax laws, and one way that we can keep doing that is to let our immigrant community members know that their data is safe with us, that unless somebody comes with a warrant issued by a court, we will hold their data safe,\u201d Lierman said.\u00a0\nHowever, some officials raised concerns about public safety and potential federal repercussions.\nDaniel Galbraith, warden of the Harford County Detention Center, argued that the bill could compromise law enforcement efforts. Harford County deputies currently share information with ICE after individuals are arrested for crimes, allowing ICE to conduct investigations in a secure environment.\n\u201cIf enacted, this legislation will remove our ability to participate in this key public safety program,\u201d Galbraith said.\nDaniel Franklin, chief of police of Morningside Police Department, warned that the bill could strain Maryland\u2019s relationship with the federal government.\u00a0\n\u201cThe passage of this bill may have some extremely negative results for state and local cooperation with federal agencies across the board, as well as any federal funding that we may receive as the state of Maryland,\u201d Franklin said.\nBut George Escobar, chief of programs and services of CASA, said that the bill isn\u2019t meant to hinder law enforcement, but uphold constitutional integrity.\n\u201cEvery day we learn of new data breaches authorized by rogue actors friendly to the administration in their unlawful obsession to unscrupulously hunt and demonize immigrants,\u201d Escobar said. \u201cIt is incumbent upon this body to ensure access to data, information collected from all residents be protected and shared in accordance with the law.\u201d\nLam stressed that the bill is not about opposing federal immigration law but about safeguarding the privacy and trust of Maryland residents. By requiring federal agencies to obtain a warrant before accessing state databases, the legislation aims to protect personal information while maintaining public safety.\n\u201cIt is critical to preserve the trust of our community and to protect them from aggressive federal action that threatens their livelihoods,\u201d Lam said.\nIf the bill passes, the Maryland attorney general would be in charge of enforcing these restrictions. Civil penalties of up to $1,000 per violation could be imposed and state employees who violate these provisions could face disciplinary action, including termination.",

    "summary": "Fear of ICE raids has led many undocumented immigrants on the Delmarva Peninsula to stay home, emptying usually bustling areas and potentially foreshadowing a labor shortage in key industries. Despite the tension, some remain hopeful while preparing for possible enforcement actions.",
    "content": "GEORGETOWN, Delaware \u2013 Race Street, usually the busy commercial core of a Central American neighborhood, was deserted on a clear weekday evening.\nA man named Delmar sat in an otherwise empty restaurant, sipping a hot drink from a styrofoam cup. Unlike many of his neighbors, he told a visitor, he\u2019s not reacting prematurely to the possibility of immigration raids.\u00a0\nHe\u2019s remaining hopeful, he said, but he\u2019s also prepared.\n\u201cEl plan A es esperarse,\u201d he said. \u201cEl plan B es prepararse.\u201d\u00a0\nThe region\u2019s key industries, Delmar added, should see the empty businesses on Race Street as a sign of oncoming trouble. Without undocumented immigrants like him, the Delmarva Peninsula\u2019s construction, agriculture and hospitality employers could face a critical labor shortage.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to the workforce?\u201d he asked in Spanish. \u201cThey need the value that immigrants provide.\u201d\nNot all immigrants in Georgetown without legal status are as relaxed as Delmar.\u00a0\nAs rumors of pending raids circulate through rural communities on the Delmarva Peninsula, places like Race Street have grown eerily quiet. The mere possibility that the Trump administration might follow through on its mass deportation plans is enough to have a chilling effect in rural towns where many immigrants feel especially visible.\u00a0\nCapital News Service is not using the last names of undocumented immigrants or those in the asylum process at their request, to protect their identities.\u00a0\nDrawn initially by the region\u2019s poultry industry and other agricultural work, thousands of immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean settled in small towns and cities on the peninsula over the past five decades.\u00a0\nThe peninsula remains a destination for new migrants. Since 2020, Wicomico County has received more new immigrants with cases in federal immigration court \u2013 including asylum seekers \u2013 per capita than any other county in Maryland, according to an immigration court case database maintained by the Department of Justice.\nThe same data indicates that both Wicomico County and Accomack County on Virginia\u2019s eastern shore received more post-2020 immigrants per capita than Los Angeles County.\u00a0\nChildren and grandchildren of those immigrants now make up a large share of the student body at North Georgetown Elementary, which serves children from the neighborhood surrounding Race Street.\u00a0\nJennifer Nein, a multi-language learning coordinator who works at the school, said her students are on edge.\n\u201cI\u2019ve noticed a few kids who are a little bit quieter than they normally are,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I say, \u2018Are you alright,\u2019 they come right out and tell you, \u2018I\u2019m just really scared. I\u2019m scared that I\u2019m going to go home and my parents are going to be gone.\u2019\u201d\nAnother student recounted panicking at the sound of someone knocking on the door of their home, Nein said, only to discover that the visitor was a family member.\u00a0\nNein noted that while her school has yet to see attendance drop substantially, some families are planning for the worst-case scenario, including arranging powers of attorney and identifying family members or neighbors who could take their children in if they are deported.\u00a0\nMargarita, an immigrant from Mexico who works at a restaurant on Race Street, said she\u2019s watched families in her orbit prepare to take their U.S.-born children with them if they are forced to leave the country.\n\u201cThose who were born here and have immigrant parents \u2013 their parents are looking for ways to obtain passports and send their children to Guatemala,\u201d she said in Spanish.\nLina, a Guatemalan immigrant in Selbyville, a town twenty miles south of Georgetown on the Delaware-Maryland border, told CNS that she plans to take her two children with her if U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ramps up its enforcement efforts on the peninsula.\n\u201cFor me, it would be ideal to first see if they really do start arresting people around here,\u201d she said in Spanish. \u201cThen I would leave with my daughters.\u201d\nAt least a few of her acquaintances, she added, decided to preemptively cut their losses and return to their home countries.\u00a0\nFrom behind the counter of a restaurant in Selbyville, Maria, an immigrant from Mexico, said that the same anxieties are straining businesses that rely on immigrant customers.\u00a0\nSince President Trump\u2019s inauguration last month, Maria said that the restaurant has seen few dine-in orders as worried regulars try to minimize the time they spend in public spaces. Some take-out customers, she added, insist that she check the parking lot for signs of immigration enforcement before they come to pick up their meals.\u00a0\n\u201cWhen sales go down, work goes down,\u201d Maria said. While the restaurant usually requires two servers per shift, she worked a weekday lunch hour alone in late January. At that rate, she said, some businesses in small towns like Selbyville may not survive.\u00a0\nThose precautions aren\u2019t unique to undocumented immigrants.\u00a0\n\u201cThere are citizens here,\u201d said Jean-Frandy Philogene, the outreach and field coordinator with the Maryland office of a farmworker assistance nonprofit Comit\u00e9 de Apoyo a los Trabajadores Agr\u00edcolas, or CATA. \u201cBut even though they are [citizens], they are scared \u2013 some of them \u2013 because they don\u2019t know exactly how they\u2019re going to do the deportations.\u201d\nPhilogene said he\u2019s met naturalized citizens in the Salisbury area who, despite carrying proof of their citizenship, are still cutting back their non-essential visits to workplaces and businesses.\u00a0\nSo far, he added, only a handful of the immigrant workers in his orbit have decided to avoid their workplaces.\u00a0\nBut the Rev. Roosevelt Toussaint, president of the Haitian Development Center of Delmarva, thinks that may not last.\u00a0\nHis organization serves thousands of Salisbury-area Haitian immigrants who entered the country after the Biden administration launched a \u201chumanitarian parole\u201d for immigrants from four countries, including Haiti, in January 2023. That program allowed parolees to live and work in the United States for two years.\nThe Biden administration later opted not to renew the legal status of immigrants who arrived through the program, and Trump formally ended the program by executive order on his first day in office. While those immigrants generally still have legal status, Toussaint said it\u2019s unclear whether the Trump administration will offer an alternative path for them to remain in the country.\u00a0\n\u201cThere\u2019s a fear among the business owners,\u201d he said, that Haitian workers might disappear if they are left in legal limbo. \u201cSo they are looking for options \u2013 what options are there for those employees to seek [legal status]?\u201d\u00a0\nTom Super, the senior vice president of communications for the National Chicken Council, told CNS that his industry has yet to see workforce impacts.\u00a0\nBut Leila Borrero Krouse, an organizer in CATA\u2019s Maryland office, said it\u2019s unclear whether the migrant farmworkers who come to the peninsula in the summer to pick watermelons, tomatoes and other produce will return this year.\nWhispers about upcoming workplace raids have already begun to spread in Georgetown.\u00a0\nLt. Joel Diaz, the city\u2019s deputy police chief, said his department received a flurry of calls about alleged ICE arrests at restaurants and other businesses last month, none of which proved accurate.\u00a0\nEarly last week, however, ICE agents appeared in Georgetown to detain a fugitive, giving the police department advance notice of their arrival.\u00a0\nDiaz said the operation wasn\u2019t the first of its kind in Georgetown, but his department is now trying to dispel misinformation and calm the town\u2019s nerves.\u00a0\n\u201cThat initial blast is what makes folks uneasy,\u201d he said.\nImmigration raids are nothing new on the Delmarva Peninsula. In 1996, federal immigration agents arrested more than 100 workers at two poultry processing plants on Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore.\u00a0\nThat era\u2019s raids prompted some Haitians to depart for Canada, Toussaint said, as did Trump\u2019s first term in office.\n\u201cEvery time there\u2019s a change in the federal government, there\u2019s always a stir for people to move,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nCelsa, an immigrant from Mexico who came to Georgetown in the early 2000s, told CNS that while more recent arrivals might be alarmed by the Trump administration\u2019s rhetoric on immigration, she doesn\u2019t believe the next four years in Georgetown will be meaningfully different than the last two decades.\n\u201cTodo el tiempo ha sido lo mismo,\u201d she said. It\u2019s always been like this.",

Brown, Maryland\u2019s attorney general, said the Trump order violates the 14th Amendment as well as federal law. Brown and the other attorneys general filed the suit against Trump in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.\n\u201cBirthright citizenship is a right enshrined in our Constitution,\u201d Brown said in a press release issued on Tuesday. \u201cIt is a reflection of our country\u2019s ideals, a belief that every baby born on U.S. soil is a member of our great nation and deserves to play a part in its future.\u201d\nThe 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution says that \u201call persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\u201d\nEnding that, said Brown, would be \u201cun-American.\u201d\n\u201cOur office will vigorously challenge this blatantly unconstitutional decision in court,\u201d he said.\nThe order was one of Trump\u2019s very first executive acts after his inauguration this week. Posted on the White House website, the order says that citizenship should not be granted to a person whose mother was unlawfully or temporarily present in the U.S. at the time of the child\u2019s birth, and whose father was not a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident.\nTrump issued the order on Monday amid a slew of executive orders that ranged from withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization to announcing pardons for people convicted or criminally charged in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\nAccording to the filing, Maryland joins in the suit with the states of New Jersey, Massachusetts, California, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Michigan, Colorado, Delaware, Nevada, Hawaii, Maine, Minnesota, New Mexico, Vermont, Wisconsin and North Carolina along with Washington, D.C., and the city and county of San Francisco.\n\u201cIn his inaugural remarks, President Trump promised to \u2018restore fair, equal and impartial justice under the constitutional rule of law,\u2019\u201d U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, said in a statement sent to Capital News Service. \u201cHe betrayed his own words almost immediately by pardoning roughly 1,500 people convicted of crimes related to the Jan. 6 insurrection.\u201d\nAdvocates are also gearing up to fight the Trump order.\n\u201cIt is such an obvious violation of the Constitution,\u201d Jossie Flor Sapunar, the national communications director for CASA, a Latino advocacy organization, told CNS. \u201cThe 14th Amendment is very clear in the guarantee that any person born or naturalized in the U.S. is a citizen of the U.S. and whatever state they reside in.\u201d\nThe organization is preparing to file its own lawsuit against Trump, she said.\n\u201cThe fact that President Trump thinks that he is higher in power than the Constitution is wrong,\u201d Sapunar said, \u201cand he\u2019s going to find out just how quick he is mistaken.\u201d",

ICE removed more than 250,000 people the previous year, 55 percent of which were convicted of felonies or misdemeanors, according to the agency.\nThe result in Langley Park was widespread panic, largely empty streets and residents hesitant to leave their homes, according to a CBS report from July 2019.\nWith the president-elect declaring even more drastic measures during his second term, Lung-Amam worries for areas with large migrant populations.\n\u201cWhat I fear for communities like Langley Park are not just the level of deportations \u2026 but the larger sense that that community doesn\u2019t matter, or that the people in it don\u2019t matter,\u201d Lung-Amam said.\nImmigrants without legal status represent 4.2 percent of Maryland\u2019s overall population and nearly a quarter of Maryland\u2019s immigration population, according to the American Immigration Council, a Washington-based nonprofit advocacy group.\nNearly 150,000 individuals without legal status are employed in Maryland, according to a 2019 report by the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington. More than a quarter of this population works in construction; 17 percent in professional, scientific, management, administrative, and waste management services; and 15 percent in accommodation and food services, entertainment and recreation.\n\nPeople living in the country without legal permission paid more than $1.2 billion in taxes, including $476.3 million in state and local taxes, and $4.3 billion in total spending power in 2022, according to the American Immigration Council.\n\u201cUnauthorized immigrants, over their lifetimes, contribute far more in terms of tax payments and productivity than they cost,\u201d Michelle Mittelstadt, the director of communications for the Migration Policy Institute, said.\nLast month, Gov. Wes Moore told The Baltimore Banner that he is grateful for immigrants communities\u2019 contributions to the state and is committed to protecting all Marylanders, regardless of \u201cthe actions the new administration takes on immigration policy.\u201d\nThe United States historically has expelled the majority of migrants without legal status to Mexico and other Central American countries. And with the majority of those living in Maryland without legal permission hailing from those nations, according to the Migration Policy Institute, Mittelstadt said the state could see a larger number of deported people in Trump\u2019s second term.\n\nThe nation has experienced several mass deportation episodes in the past. Most recently, nearly 454,000 migrants living in the country without legal permission were deported between 2008 and 2014, according to a study by Robert Lynch, an economics professor at Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland.\n\u201cIn each of these episodes, politicians and proponents of the deportations asserted that the policy would create jobs for American workers, raise their wages and grow the economy,\u201d Lynch said on a Nov. 20 virtual press call. \u201cBut in each case, jobs for American workers did not materialize, their wages did not go up and the economy did not grow.\u201d\nOne of the modern examples of mass deportations within the United States centered around Arizona, where anti-immigration laws resulted in the state losing an estimated 40 percent of its workers living in the country without legal status between 2008 and 2015. While a national recession at the same time resulted in immigrants leaving several states, a study co-authored by Lynch in July found that Arizona had the greatest decline in its migrant population.\nIn the aftermath of its policies, Arizona saw a 2.5 percent decrease in total employment due to the departures, according to a Moody\u2019s Analytics analysis, and American-born, non-Hispanic white men in the state saw a 2 percent decline in employment rates.\nIn his first term, Trump cut refugee admissions to historic levels, enacted a Muslim travel ban and made it more difficult for immigrants of all statuses to enter the country.\nNotably for Maryland, Trump changed the H-2B visa program, a seasonal visa for foreign workers, from first-come, first-served to a lottery system, which hurt the Maryland crabbing industry.\n\u201cWomen, particularly from Mexico, have come to Maryland during the crab-picking season to work and do these jobs,\u201d Mittelstadt said. \u201cThese are not considered high-skill jobs. However, it does take a very particular skill to do them.\u201d\nIn August 2018, the Washington Post reported that about a third of crab-picking jobs were vacant across the Eastern Shore.\nLynch argues that large-scale mass deportations only hurt the local and federal economies, partially due to the misnomer that deporting working immigrants creates more jobs for Americans.\n\u201cThe idea that mass deportation will help American citizens in the future is likely an illusion,\u201d Lynch said during the press call, rejecting the notion that immigrants living in the United States without legal permission are doing the jobs American workers otherwise would do.\n\u201c(Those living in the country without legal status) have different skills, different abilities to work, different willingness to work,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cThey are often not in competition with American workers but they work cooperatively, increasing each other\u2019s productivity and wages, creating more jobs and growing the economy for everyone.\u201d\nAs many as 28 million Americans will be in families with at least one member without legal status by the beginning of 2025, according to a report from FWD.us, a bipartisan political organization advocating immigration and criminal justice reforms.\nIn Maryland, 84,000 immigrants without legal status are married and 51,000 of them are married to non-U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, according to the Migration Policy Institute.\nOrr worries that Maryland may see a decline in consumers\u2019 spending in anticipation of Trump\u2019s second term, which may combine the mass deportation of immigrants without legal documentation to live in the country with a dramatic slash to the federal government, which is the largest single employer in the state.\n\u201cIt will be a shock both morally and ethically,\u201d Orr said. \u201cA shock to families and communities and a shock to our economy that will be very difficult to recover from.\u201d",

    "content": "MILWAUKEE \u2013 The brother of a Maryland woman whose 2023 murder has fanned the flames of immigration policy debate addressed a packed stadium of delegates Tuesday night at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.\u00a0\n\u201cOpen borders are often portrayed as compassionate and virtuous,\u201d said Michael Morin, 40, of Churchville, Maryland. \u201cBut there is nothing compassionate about allowing violent criminals into our country and robbing children of their mother. My sister\u2019s death was preventable.\u201d\u00a0\nRachel Morin, a 37-year-old mother of five, was reported missing August 5, 2023, after going for a jog on the Ma & Pa Trail in Bel Air. Her body was found nearby the following day.\nAfter 10 months of investigation, Harford County Sheriff Jeff Gahler announced in a June 15 press conference the arrest of Victor Antonio Martinez-Hernandez, a 23-year-old citizen of El Salvador, for Rachel\u2019s murder.\u00a0\nAccording to Gahler, the suspect illegally entered the country in February 2023 after allegedly murdering a woman in his home country. Martinez-Hernandez is also accused of a home invasion and assault in Los Angeles in March of last year.\u00a0\nVideo and DNA evidence from the California crime helped law enforcement connect Morin\u2019s murder to Martinez-Hernandez. Authorities in Tulsa, Oklahoma, arrested Martinez-Hernandez and extradited him to Maryland.\u00a0\nMaryland State Sen. Johnny Ray Salling, R-Baltimore County, is one of 24 convention delegates in Milwaukee. Salling told Capital News Service on July 11: \u201cWe have a problem with crime along the border. We have criminals that are coming to our nation that are just, not committing crimes, that they\u2019re murdering people.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cWe had it here in Maryland, as you know, in Harford County,\u201d Salling said, referring to Morin\u2019s death. \u201cI think that\u2019s a major issue of security, of public safety.\u201d\u00a0\nDespite high profile cases like Morin\u2019s, the popular conservative theory that immigrants disproportionately commit violent crime is not based on statistical evidence.\u00a0\nA 2020 white paper by the CATO Institute, a libertarian think tank, investigated whether immigrants in Texas commit more or less violent crime than U.S. citizens.\u00a0\nThe paper concludes: \u201cWhether one focuses on criminal convictions, arrests, or the number of individuals convicted or arrested, the results are the same: illegal immigrants have a lower crime rate than native-born Americans in Texas.\u201d\u00a0\nThe CATO researchers note that Texas is the only state to record criminal arrests and convictions by immigration status.\u00a0\nDespite the lack of data to support a larger trend, conservative officials and pundits point to Morin\u2019s case and others \u2013 like the February murder of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley \u2013 to underscore what they call \u201cBiden\u2019s Border Crisis.\u201d\nAt the convention Tuesday night, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, mentioned Rachel Morin in a list of women allegedly murdered by immigrants, alongside Riley and Kate Steinle of San Francisco.\u00a0\nFox News host Sean Hannity invited Rachel\u2019s mother Patricia Morin to his show following Martinez-Hernandez\u2019s arrest.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019ve opened our doors and you let a stranger into your house,\u201d Patricia told Hannity of U.S. border security. \u201cWe\u2019re not protecting ourselves, we\u2019re not protecting our families.\u201d\u00a0\nPresident Joe Biden has not reached out to the family, according to Randolph Rice, their attorney.\u00a0\nTrump called the Morin family in June to express his condolences and later invited Patricia, Rachel\u2019s sister Rebekah and Rice to lunch June 30 at his Virginia club.\u00a0\nRice told CNS that the family supports Trump\u2019s candidacy and \u201ccontinues to support anyone willing to make changes at the southern border that will prevent another murder like Rachel\u2019s.\u201d\nTo a crowded convention floor Tuesday night, Michael Morin concluded: \u201cI pray that we hold worldly leaders accountable for safety and justice for innocent people. I pray that we make our country safe and secure in the memory of my sister Rachel, who loved life.\u201d\nMILWAUKEE \u2013 The theme of the second night of the Republican National Convention was \u201cMake America Safe Again,\u201d where speakers talked about border policy and, pictured here, Michael Morin spoke about the murder of his sister, Rachel Morin. (Caley Fox Shannon/Capital News Service)\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat, and former Maryland Gov.

    "summary": "The Supreme Court is deliberating whether a U.S. citizen can challenge the denial of a visa for their noncitizen spouse based on allegations of intended unlawful activity, with the case centering on Sandra Mu\u00f1oz and her husband Luis Asencio-Cordero, whose visa was denied due to suspected gang ties.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Supreme Court justices seemed conflicted Tuesday during oral arguments over whether a U.S. citizen can challenge the denial of a visa for a noncitizen spouse because the government expected that spouse to engage in unlawful activity.\nThe State Department in fiscal 2023 denied almost 5,400 visa applications from noncitizens attempting to live with their citizen spouses or fiances using the unlawful activity, according to the agency\u2019s attorney, Curtis Gannon.\nThe high court is being asked if denying a visa for a noncitizen impinges on the U.S. citizen spouse\u2019s constitutionally protected interests and if simply citing the law behind a visa denial provides a sufficient reason for that denial.\nThe case centers on Sandra Mu\u00f1oz, a California attorney, who married El Salvadorian citizen Luis Asencio-Cordero in 2010.\nIn 2015, the U.S. consulate in San Salvador denied Asencio-Cordero\u2019s visa application. This was done under the provision that an officer can deny visas to anyone believed to be to enter the country to engage in unlawful activity.\nThe couple was not told why the consular officer believed that Asencio-Cordero was likely to engage in this activity until after the one-year deadline to respond to the denied visa expired.\nThe State Department revealed in 2018 that the decision hinged on Asencio-Cordero\u2019s tattoos and the consular officer\u2019s belief that the body art linked Asencio-Cordero to the criminal gang MS-13, a fact that the couple and a court-approved gang expert refuted.\nA consulate\u2019s visa denial is not subject to judicial review unless the denial interferes with constitutionally protected interests of a U.S. citizen, according to the American Bar Association. Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s interest in this case is in her marriage and living with her husband, Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s representative, Eric Lee, argued.\nThe State Department appealed this case to the Supreme Court in an effort to prevent having to further explain visa denials under the unlawful activity standard in other cases, citing security concerns.\nDuring oral arguments, justices seemed somewhat convinced of Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s constitutional interests in her marriage but less so about what the State Department should have done differently regarding providing reasons for the visa denial.\nThe State Department argued that Mu\u00f1oz did not have a significant enough interest to trigger review of the consulate\u2019s decision.\n\u201cThe U.S. citizen is affected only indirectly by the government\u2019s action against the noncitizen,\u201d Gannon told the justices.\nHowever, Supreme Court cases going back over a century guarantee constitutionally protected rights of marriage, including the rights for couples to live with one another, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said.\nSotomayor said that while Mu\u00f1oz doesn\u2019t have a constitutional interest in having a visa granted, she does have an interest in her marriage, having her husband visit and getting information about why the visa was denied.\n\u201cYou\u2019re saying she\u2019s entitled to nothing. Why do we have to go that far?\u201d Sotomayor said. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just address, given all of our centuries of statements about marriage being something more?\u201d\nGannon argued that providing more information other than what provision triggered the denial could pose a national security threat. Citing reasons for why applicants, as in this case, are thought to be gang members could publicize U.S. intelligence on criminal organizations, he said.\nChief Justice John Roberts latched onto this argument during his questioning of Lee, pressuring Lee to weigh the constitutional interests of Mu\u00f1oz with the government\u2019s interest in denying visas people who present a danger to the country.\nLee said that additional information about visa denials would allow citizens to properly refute false accusations. If his client had known which gang Asencio-Cordero was believed to be associated with, Lee said, then the couple\u2019s representatives would have been able to analyze his tattoos and provide more proof of his innocence- which included Catholic imagery and Sigmond Freud \u2013 and with more specificity.\nJustices, including Elena Kagan, pressured Gannon on how much information they can provide about visa denials \u2013 including asking for one sentence as an explanation.\n\u201cOne sentence gives you a lever to try to contest an inaccuracy in what the government is doing, and the other gives you no lever at all,\u201d Kagan said.\nDuring the arguments, numerous justices critiqued Lee\u2019s arguments that focused mostly on statutes instead of the Constitution.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can answer this constitutional question by citing statutes,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito said.\nIf the court were to rule in Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s favor, Lee said in his opening statement, he hoped the government would allow her to formally refute the claim against her husband and have another chance for approval.\n\u201cShe\u2019s been permanently separated from the man that she loves for eight years without having any basis, any chance when there was an opportunity to respond under the regulations, to try and convince them that they made a mistake,\u201d Lee said.\nKeren Zwick, the director of litigation for the National Immigrant Justice Center, agreed with Lee\u2019s position and said in a statement that she believes this case is about the right to due process.\n\u201cThe right to due process is fundamental to our legal system, and we\u2019re hopeful that the Supreme Court will recognize that in this case,\u201d Zwick said.\nIf the ruling aligns with the State Department\u2019s wishes, the court would recognize that the department upheld the existing standards and provided sufficient reason for the visa being denied, Gannon said.\nHe also pushed the court to recognize that a U.S. citizen does not have interests which would trigger judicial review pertaining to a non-citizen spouse\u2019s visa.\nThe court is expected to rule on this case in June.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 More than two years after the final U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan, over 70,000 refugees from that nation are living in a legal limbo that Congress has yet to change.\nBut bipartisan legislation, known as the Afghan Adjustment Act (AAA), was introduced in July in the Senate and the House. It would provide Afghans who sought refuge in the United States with a pathway to apply for permanent legal residency.\nAfghan refugees living in the United States currently are under humanitarian parole, a temporary status not equated with permanent residency.\n\u201cGiving our Afghan allies a chance to apply for legal status is the right and necessary thing to do,\u201d stated Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minnesota, and chief sponsor of the Senate bill. \u201cThis bipartisan legislation will help provide Afghans who have sacrificed so much for our country with the legal certainty they deserve as they rebuild their lives.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\nSimilar legislation was introduced in the last session of Congress but stalled over objections from some Republicans.\n\u201cThe AAA is not simply an immigration bill,\u201d Eskinder Negash, president and CEO of the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, said in a statement. \u201cThe AAA is essential to fulfilling the United States\u2019 commitments to its national security partners and allies from America\u2019s longest war, which will affect U.S. foreign policy and security in all future conflicts and engagements.\u201d\nUnder the legislation, Afghans on humanitarian status who undergo additional vetting, including an in-person interview, would be allowed to apply for permanent legal status. This is a significant shift from the current law, which primarily offers permanent status through the asylum system or the burdensome Special Immigrant Visa program for those who worked directly with U.S. forces in Afghanistan. The legislation broadens the eligibility for the program to include groups such as the Afghan National Army Special Operations Command and the Female Tactical Teams of Afghanistan.\nThe Senate measure has 13 co-sponsors from both parties, while the House companion bill has 45 Democratic and Republican co-sponsors. Klobuchar last summer tried to get the legislation included in a defense policy bill but was blocked by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas.\u00a0\nEven so, Klobuchar is optimistic about the legislation\u2019s prospects.\n\u201cWe\u2019re working on it,\u201d the senator told Capital News Service on Thursday. \u201cWe hope to attach it to one of the end-of-the-year bills.\u201d\nSen. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, and one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors, told an audience in his home state in October that objections were being addressed in talks about the measure.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like every immigration bill in the United States, in Congress,\u201d Moran said, according to Kansas Reflector. \u201cIt is picked to death, and nothing seems to happen. The goal is to have this bill completed by the end of the year.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe United States is deeply grateful to the Afghan nationals who risked their lives to advance the U.S. mission in Afghanistan over two decades,\u201d said Sen. Van Hollen, D-Maryland, who supports the legislation. \u201cPassing the bipartisan Afghan Adjustment Act would demonstrate this gratitude by providing our Afghan allies who have sought refuge in our country with a reliable path to living legally and safely in America.\u201d\u00a0\nHowever, some GOP lawmakers have raised objections over the Afghan refugee bill because of broader concerns over the state of the U.S. immigration system.\u00a0\nSen. James Lankford, R-Oklahoma, pointed out the stark increase in overall asylum requests, framing it as a testament to the system\u2019s dysfunction.\u00a0\n\u201cIn 2010, we had 21,000 asylum requests for the year across our Southwest border; now we often have that in three days. It\u2019s an enormous shift,\u201d Lankford said during an Oct. 1 hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which was exploring threats to United States. \u201cOur entire immigration system is broken. There\u2019s unanimity about that.\u201d\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Florida, said at the hearing thorough vetting was critical, citing the potential dangers posed by individuals from countries with histories of anti-Semitism and hostility toward the American way of life.\u00a0\nReferencing data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Scott highlighted the significant number of Afghan nationals admitted to the United States.\u00a0\n\u201cThat\u2019s almost 77,000 people from Afghanistan, largely unvetted, as well as 659 from Iran and 538 from Syria,\u201d the senator said. \u201cRemember it took 19 terrorists to do 9/11.\u201d\nVetting also was Cotton\u2019s concern in his move to block Klobuchar from including her bill in a defense policy measure.\n\u201cWe should provide (the Afghans) with legal stability and a path to successfully integrate into the U.S., but we can\u2019t cut corners or risk giving green cards to terrorists embedded in the evacuated masses,\u201d Cotton\u2019s office said in a statement.\u00a0\u00a0\nBut Mahdi Rasikh, a former member of the Afghan Parliament and now a parolee, said Afghans have been a positive presence in the United States, emphasizing that many Afghans stood against terrorism for two decades and now deserve the American government\u2019s support.\n\u201cMany Afghan parolees awaiting asylum decisions are facing uncertainty and, as a result, mental health challenges due to the loss of their homes and separation from loved ones who remain in Afghanistan or in unsafe third countries,\u201d Rasikh said. \u201cIf the act fails to pass, it risks breeding mistrust among those who assisted foreign troops, including the U.S. government.\u201d\nDaniel Salazar, policy analyst at USCRI, said American officials showed due diligence in vetting Afghans despite the chaotic nature of the evacuation.\n\u201cAfghan parolees overwhelmingly were processed and vetted when they were at the airport in Kabul, vetted and processed further at overseas military bases called lily pads in the initial kind of stages after the evacuation, and then they were processed domestically,\u201d Salazar explained.\u00a0\nHe added that if there are any worries regarding the thoroughness of the vetting process, the Afghan Adjustment Act offers a solution, which is the requirement for the Afghan parolees to complete a further vetting procedure to transition their status to that of a lawful permanent resident.\nFatema Hosseini, who reports for the Washington Bureau of Capital News Service, formerly was a full-time journalist for more than two-and-a-half years for Kabul Now, a leading Afghan news organization. She was evacuated from Afghanistan during the U.S. military withdrawal from that country, first going to Ukraine and later arriving in the United States on Sept. 11, 2021.",

    "summary": "Since 2000, nearly 14,000 Americans have sought asylum in other countries, primarily Canada, challenging the U.S.'s image as a safe haven. Reasons include political persecution, domestic violence, and fear of family separation due to deportation.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 At the foot of the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor are the words \u201cGive me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\u201d inviting the oppressed and downtrodden from across the globe to America\u2019s protective embrace. Yet since 2000, almost 14,000 Americans have applied for asylum in other countries.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe dangers of life in America outweigh the benefits for some Americans, according to a new paper from Jayesh Rathod, a professor of law at American University\u2019s Washington College of Law. This stands in stark contrast to America\u2019s self-image as the land of the free.\u00a0\n\u201cAs somebody who studies immigration law, part of the narrative that I impart to my students, and that those of us living in this country, and even abroad are aware of, is that the United States is portrayed as a destination country, the premiere destination country for immigrants,\u201d Rathod told Capital News Service in an interview. \u201cAnd in some ways what this trend is doing is pretty profoundly disrupting that narrative.\u201d\nRathod\u2019s paper primarily focuses on the rare phenomenon of American citizens seeking asylum in other countries because they feel unsafe in this country. Since 2000, just under 14,000 asylum applications have been made by United States citizens to other countries, with Canada being the top destination by far.\u00a0\nRathod outlines various reasons why Americans may choose to take the leap. There are, of course, political dissidents \u2013 Edward Snowden and others who can become propaganda tools for governments at odds with the United States. There are domestic violence survivors, like Holly Ann Collins, who in the 1990s was granted asylum in the Netherlands after escaping an abusive husband in the United States.\u00a0\nIn addition, many asylum applications are cases of families where the children are U.S. citizens by birth but the parents are immigrants to the United States who feared deportation and the separation of their families. This was especially prominent during the presidency of Donald Trump and the data reflects a large spike in asylum applications following his victory in 2016.\u00a0\n\nThe grounds upon which a person can claim asylum are narrow. Criteria for who may claim asylum vary by country, but generally the United States is not considered dangerous enough to warrant asylum.\u00a0\nThe United States makes for an interesting case because persecution does not exist equally across the country. Someone can move between states and find different levels of legal and social acceptance. Given the patchwork, most American asylum claims fail.\u00a0\nWhen asked how often these claims succeed, Rathod said: \u201cNot very often. So that\u2019s another finding is that of the 14,000 or so claims that were lodged by U.S. citizens from 2000-2021, fewer than 400 were granted. So what that tells us is that there\u2019s a general sense that the U.S. can still protect people.\u201d\nOne group of emigres highlighted in Rashod\u2019s paper are trans and queer people who no longer feel safe living in the United States. Researchers at UCLA\u2019s Williams Institute found that transgender people are four times more likely to be the victims of violent crime than their cisgendered counterparts.\u00a0\nNot only that, but violence against trans people has been on the rise in recent years. Both 2021 and 2022 were record-breaking years for violence against trans people. According to the Human Rights Campaign, there were at least 38 trans people killed by gun violence or other violent means. Most of this violence is perpetrated against Black and Latina transgender women.\u00a0\nGiven the increased risk of violence in the United States, a life abroad has seemed appealing to some members of the trans community.\u00a0\nIn deep red North Dakota, Zara Crystal and other activists are working to get trans people out of the country through the new non-profit TRANSport. The group started on Facebook and achieved 501(c)(3) nonprofit status in November. The organization will focus on moving trans people in difficult situations out of the country and to a safer locations of their choosing.\u00a0\nBefore even attempting an asylum application, TRANSport will help make its clients have their passports, paperwork, money and medical needs in order for relocation. The organization is currently raising money and plans to begin accepting applications in March.\u00a0\nCrystal herself hopes to eventually start a new life in Sweden, which a survey by UCLA\u2019s Williams Institute ranked among the most supportive countries for transgender rights.\nSweden also is where transgender activist Danni Askini sought asylum in 2018. The 20-year-old grew up in a small, conservative North Dakota town with a conservative evangelical Christian family. In high school, she underwent four years of conversion therapy before running away to Fargo.\u00a0\nWhile Fargo has been an improvement, Crystal said she still feels alienated: \u201cI never felt at home in the United States. I\u2019ve always felt other. And it got to the point where so many people were sending me death threats and stuff. I just didn\u2019t feel safe here anymore.\u201d\u00a0\nShe told CNS the threats,\u00a0 combined with concerns over proposed anti-LGBT legislation, spurred her to make solid plans to leave the States.\u00a0\nThere are those who have already been able to establish new lives abroad, even without asylum, like Julia and Justine, a couple who moved to Berlin, Germany, during the Trump administration.\u00a0 They asked that their last names remain confidential.\nJustine is a trans woman who originally fled violence and abuse in rural Arkansas before landing in the Washington, D.C., area.\u00a0\nIn Washington, Justine met Julia and found work as a contractor with U.S .Citizenship and Immigration Services, an agency of the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for immigration and naturalization services. Justine had concerns about the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies, but an incident in 2018 served as the catalyst for her departure from the United States.\n\nJustine was leading a hackerspace in Washington\u2019s Columbia Heights neighborhood when Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers conducted a raid in the neighborhood. Some of Justine\u2019s students were undocumented and the raid served as her \u201croad to Damascus\u201d moment. She realized she needed to get out. Around the same time, she saw a job posting with a tech startup in Berlin.\u00a0\nFor Justine, Berlin was the obvious choice: she had been there several times before and actually spent time living in Germany as a child when her father was in the military. When asked if she would ever come back to the United States, Justine expressed concerns about the state of American democracy and anti-LGBT laws, especially ones targetting teachers.\u00a0\n\u201cI think they have effectively made the practice of me just being myself and teaching people illegal,\u201d Justine said. Recruiters have contacted her about job openings in places like Texas, but that\u2019s off the table for Justine: \u201cNo, no, no, you cannot pay me enough to go to Texas.\u201d\nJustine and Julia are active users on the subreddit /r/AmerExit. The page, which has over 30,000 members, is dedicated to Americans who no longer want to live in the United States.\u00a0\nThere seems to be a large interest in life abroad among American citizens, even if asylum may not be on the table. A 2019 Gallup poll found that record numbers of Americans wanted to leave the country. The survey found that 40% of women under 30 would rather live in another country. Canada was the most desired destination.\u00a0\nWhile the vast majority of Americans will not be permanently leaving their country,\u00a0 Rathod said that it is an important question to ask why people feel that they need to not only leave their town or state but also the country as a whole.\u00a0\n\u201cThe point is that people are feeling like, well, it\u2019s just not worth it for me to live in this country,\u201d Rathod said. \u201c Now, you know, so I think that\u2019s an important and really, for me, a very powerful message that we need to pay attention to.\u201d",

    "content": "A map of El Salvador shows San Pedro Masahuat, a rural town aobut 45 minutes southeast of the capital, where Juan Dominguez grew up. (Jon Meltzer/Capital News Service)\nFor 24 years, Juan Dominguez has been the head housekeeper at the Centreville Hall dormitory, home to nearly 545 students at the University of Maryland. He moves quietly with his broom and vacuum throughout the building\u2019s lobby each day while his team of four others clean bathrooms, empty trash cans and mop floors in the common areas of the eight-story building.\n\u201cI try to help my coworker\u2026 I like it because I feel those people look happy,\u201d said Dominguez, 60, as he rubbed his wrinkled, calloused hands together while processing the most accurate choice of words.\nHe is rarely greeted by a passerby. Students, like freshman Ari Abramovitz, say they may recognize the person who cleans on their floor but, \u201cThat\u2019s about it,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, Dominguez has built relationships with a few students over the years. Eventually, he has to watch them move on from their studies.\n\u201cI love to see the graduation because everyone look[s] happy, emotional\u2026 with their father, their mother, their whole family,\u201d he said. \u201cI love it completely.\u201d\nDominguez came to Maryland from Los Angeles after fleeing the civil war in El Salvador more than 40 years ago. Some 1.4 million Salvadorans have also come to the United States to escape the war and enduring instability, according to the Migration Policy Institute. In 2021, about 45 Hispanic employees worked on the university\u2019s 141-member housekeeping staff, according to university data. Dominguez has worked on the Centreville staff longer than anyone.\nOn the first Friday of the university\u2019s family weekend, Dominguez swept the building\u2019s lobby with a push broom from a small storage room. Despite the presence of two coworkers, he kept to himself.\nAt the lobby\u2019s desk, a student employee blasted indie music. Other housekeepers tuned it out with their own earbuds. Dominguez seemed satisfied with the sounds of vacuums and an 18-year-old\u2019s playlist.\nThat same day, Dominguez\u2019s wrinkled chin rested on his hands atop a broom handle as he admired the sunrise through one of the dorm\u2019s arched windows.\n\u201cI feel comfortable, I try to stay as long as possible,\u201d he said about his job at the university.\nDominguez grew up about a 45-minute drive southeast of the capital of San Salvador in rural San Pedro Masahuat, home to 25,000 people, where everyone knew their neighbors. He still prefers the simpler life there \u2013 one without the thrumming of car engines and the hustle of work commuters.\nAt age 19, he left his family in 1980 to find employment in the United States. Just a year into the Salvadoran civil war, Dominguez started his journey to meet his cousin in Los Angeles.\nFor three months he was stuck in Mexico City with no way to communicate with his family. Dominguez said he was lucky to find someone who gave him housing and food.\nThe family who provided him shelter in Mexico cautioned against his journey.\n\u201cThey said: \u2018don\u2019t go to the United States because you take the risk of them putting you out and sending you back\u2019,\u201d he recalled being warned.\nHe eventually took buses to Los Angeles, but he had no idea where he was going. He remembers having to ask others for help and studying maps posted at different bus stations to find his way.\n\u201cWe have to suffer a lot. The food is different, language is the same. Spanish but different words,\u201d he said about the barriers he faced during his travels.\nDominguez didn\u2019t have money to pay for the bus ticket and neither did his cousin, who arranged to have someone else pay off the fares for him.\n\u201cSomebody give me money to pay it off, it was a terrible situation,\u201d he sighed.\nIn Los Angeles, he worked as a machine operator in a sewing factory. Dominguez knew very few people, he said, and wasn\u2019t a fan of California\u2019s weather. He first met his wife while living in an apartment with her cousin.\nHis two daughters and a son were born in Los Angeles.\nIn 1995, Dominguez and his wife decided to find better jobs. His wife moved to Maryland first and he followed. His children attended local schools.\n\u201cWhen we came here, I didn\u2019t know the places or the people,\u201d he said. \u201cThe hard part is we had no idea how we get started.\u201d\nHe was hesitant to take a housekeeping job at the university because he had never worked a cleaning job before. The department offered three months of training to help him.\nAfter 24 years, Dominguez now thinks it\u2019s time to retire which he plans to do next year.\n\u201cI would like to continue here, but my time is coming,\u201d he said.\nLike many Salvadorans who left during the civil war, he hopes to return to El Salvador with his wife to live out his life.\nFleeing a Destructive War\nBut El Salvador has sunk deep into criminal activity over the last four decades. Home to about 6.5 million people, it has become a transit country for drug trafficking from Colombia to the United States.\nAdam Isacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America, said that rural areas in El Salvador have experienced an increase in gang activity and presence since the end of the civil war.\nThe gangs MS-13 and Barrio 18 account for 84% of the forced displacements, according to the Civil Society Roundtable Against Forced Displacement by Violence and Organized Crime in El Salvador. Out of 144 specific cases of displacement, 11 were in the La Paz department, where Dominguez is from.\nThe harsh law enforcement policies of President Nayib Bukele has helped decrease the crime rate since he was elected in 2019. He introduced a state of emergency to crack down on gangs that have terrorized citizens with executions, extortion and kidnappings. But Bukele\u2019s campaign also suspends some civil rights and bans journalists from reporting on gang activity. His approval rating is nearly 85%, making him the most popular president in El Salvador\u2019s history.\nSince August 2022, more than 50,000 Salvadorans suspected of gang involvement have been detained.\nBegun in 1979, a 12-year civil war between the government and the leftist Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front, cost 75,000 lives. The United States, in the name of fighting Soviet-backed Communism, provided more than a billion dollars in military aid to El Salvador from 1980 to 1990, according to the General Accounting Office.i\nThe war displaced more than a million Salvadorans within the country. The U.S. government granted 195,000 Salvadorans Temporary Protected Status visas until the Trump administration removed protections in 2018.\nFound Family\nPacking up his life has been no easy task for Dominguez, who has traveled great distances in search of stability. He remains hopeful about returning home to his mother.\nIn 2003, Dominguez bought a truck that he plans on driving to El Salvador, despite how old it\u2019s gotten.\n\u201cIt don\u2019t look good, but it\u2019s working good. I keep it,\u201d he said.\nUntil he leaves, Dominguez is content at Centreville Hall, 24 years on. \u201cIt\u2019s fair and I love it.\u201d",

    "summary": "Luis Rodriguez, a Salvadoran immigrant living in Maryland, runs an auto repair shop and embodies the hardworking spirit of the nearly 1.3 million Salvadorans who fled their country's civil war, but still feels the impact through daily calls to family facing gang violence. His sister Maribel, running a business in San Miguel, El Salvador, pays extortion fees to MS-13 to protect her family from harm.",
    "content": "A map of El Salvador shows the city of San Carlos, a small rural town, where Luis Rodriguez and his siblings grew up. (Jon Meltzer/Capital News Service)\nTo the sound of Spanish music and the smell of gasoline, Luis Rodriguez\u2019s grease-caked hands fix battered cars and broken down trucks at Brothers Auto Service in Hyattsville, Maryland, where wrenches turn from before dawn to after dusk.\nTrying to schedule appointments is easy. \u201cI am always here,\u201d Rodriguez, 64, said with a smile.\nSince the Salvadoran civil war four decades ago, nearly 1.3 million Salvadorans like Rodriguez have come to the United States seeking safety from a conflict and its aftermath that is now long-forgotten by many Washington decision-makers but always present for those whose lives were changed forever. \nRoughly 200,000 Salvadorans are now part of the rich multicultural fabric of the Washington region. Though most Salvadorans here continue to suffer the separation from family and friends, they were the lucky ones in a guerrilla war that claimed 75,000 lives. \nIn daily calls home to relatives still living in small, impoverished villages, Rodriguez, like other Salvadorans of his generation, hears echoes of the violent legacy that helped create political instability and allowed gang warfare an enduring foothold. \nLuis Rodriguez\u2019s sister, Maribel Rodriguez, lives in San Miguel, 15 miles from the small village in the Moraz\u00e1n district where she and Luis Rodriguez grew up.\nThe notorious MS-13 gang, founded by Los Angeles inmates returned to El Salvador under the Clinton administration, continues to terrorize her tire-and-rim business, demanding bribes in exchange for safety, she said in a recent interview with Capital News Service.\nMaribel Rodriguez said she would \u201cpay and pay so they [didn\u2019t] harm my family.\u201d\nSan Carlos, where the Rodriguez siblings grew up, is a small rural town where many residents practice subsistence farming. When Rodriguez lived there, educational opportunities were limited. \n\u201cI never went to school in my country \u2014 never,\u201d Luis Rodriguez said. But now, things are changing and school is available to children there.\nLuis Rodriguez regularly sends money home. His contributions were a tiny part of the $623.7 million a month that Salvadorans in the United States sent home in September alone, according to the latest figures from the Central Reserve Bank of El Salvador.\nDuring the war, the predominant guerilla group, the Farabundo Mart\u00ed National Liberation Front, or FMLN, recruited heavily in Rodriguez\u2019s area. Rodriguez said members of the group frequently appeared near his village in 1983 and kidnapped him to fight for their cause.\nThe FMLN accommodations were unconventional and Luis remembers being well-treated. \u201cIt was all underground but completely well illuminated,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was even better than a hospital in the United States\u2026. There were medics. There was everything.\u201d\nHe escaped but was kidnapped repeatedly by various guerilla factions over the next year before joining the Salvadoran military because he had heard rumors that he could acquire a U.S. visa that way.  \u201cBut it was a fraud, all a bunch of s\u2014. So, instead of staying there, I came here by myself,\u201d he said.\nBy the time Rodriguez left El Salvador in 1985, he had lived in a state of conflict for nearly five years. \nRodriguez joined his brother already living in the United States. He worked in construction until an accident forced him to learn a new trade. Eventually, the boy who learned about agriculture and animal husbandry from his father in San Carlos learned how to fix even the most difficult automobile problems. Here his family lives a peaceful middle-class life in safe, suburban Maryland.\nLuis Rodriguez stands outside of his auto mechanic shop in Hyattsville, Maryland. in Dec. 2022. (Eve Sampson/Capital News Service)\nThirty years after the war ended, El Salvador, with a population of 6.5 million, has one of the highest murder rates in the world \u2013 52 murders per 100,000 residents.\nOver a 3-day-span in March, 87 people were killed by gangs. It was the most violent weekend since the civil war. In response, Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele imposed a national state of emergency in what he said was an effort to crack down on crime. \nThe state of emergency gives police more discretion to arrest those they accuse of gang activities, increases prison sentences for gang membership, restricts citizens\u2019 freedom of assembly and imposes a blackout on gang-related news. Journalists who report on gangs can be imprisoned. \nHuman rights activists and many international organizations have condemned Bukele\u2019s state of emergency, saying it erodes constitutional rights and does not grant accused suspects due process.\nBut Bukele\u2019s popularity within the country has soared, as it has at Brothers Auto Service in Maryland.\nLuis Rodriguez said that until this year his family in El Salvador lived in fear of gang violence. Gangs would extort businesses, requiring them to pay in exchange for safety. Gangs would say, \u201cYou have to give me $400 a month,\u201d he said, for \u201cno reason.\u201d\nIn San Miguel, random young men would approach Maribel Rodriguez and force her to talk on their cell phones with MS-13 gang bosses, she said. They demanded payment and threatened to harm her family if she reported them to the police. \nShe said she had no choice but to comply. \n\u201cWe paid every month [until] the government put a very strong emergency regime law [in place]. They captured all those people five months ago,\u201d she told CNS. \u201dWe no longer pay and are very well now. A month ago, we opened a third [automotive] business.\u201d \nNow married with two adult children, Luis Rodriguez settled into the daily grind of business ownership years ago.\nPoking his head from under a battered car hood, he waves a hand toward his son, who immediately runs over from the front of the garage to the gritty inside where his father works. \nLuis Rodriguez\u2019s son, \u201cJunior\u201d Rodriguez, 27, said he grew up in awe of his father. \n\u201cHe came here not knowing English and he\u2019s here with an essential business,\u201d Junior Rodriguez said of his father. \u201cHe wanted us to go to school, go to colleges, so we\u2019re not busting our asses like he is,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wants us to be at a steady office or work for a big company where you don\u2019t have to work the 10-, 12-hour days [to] get a fair amount of salary.\u201d\nShivering early on a recent morning, Luis Rodriguez said that he still longs to return home. He plans to retire on beach property he bought along the Salvadoran coast. \n\u201cYou can look [at] Honduras, Nicaragua,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can see the fish run.\u201d",

(Jon Meltzer/Capital News Service)\nWhen Brigit Park cleans a military officer\u2019s uniform, she prefers not to know their rank. It makes her nervous, she says, to think she might mess up a senior official\u2019s uniform.\n\u201cI don\u2019t work well under pressure. If I find out that I\u2019m working on someone important, that catches me off guard. I\u2019m like, \u2018What? I worked for who?\u2019\u201d Park, 38, laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ask. I don\u2019t like to probe.\u201d \nTop Flight Cleaners, a small dry cleaners she has owned with her Korean American husband since 2016, sits in a strip mall across from the main gate of Joint Base Andrews, an Air Force base in Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. \nTop Flight is just one of thousands of U.S. dry cleaners owned by Koreans who began immigrating to major U.S. cities in large numbers after the Immigration Act of 1965 removed restrictions on Asian immigrants to the United States.\nThere are about 80,000 Korean immigrants and their children in the Washington region, according to the Institute for Immigration Research at George Mason University. Of the 1,200 dry cleaners in the Washington region, in 2001, about 80% were owned by Korean immigrants or their American-born children, according to The Washington Post. \nWith limited English skills, many Korean immigrants went to work in corner produce or liquor stores when they first arrived, said Seong Minne Koh, a Korean lecturer at the University of Maryland and a Seoul native, in a recent interview with Capital News Service.\n\u201cAt that time, a lot of people just moved here as labor workers.\u2026Korean people are diligent, and they were also desperate. In a new country, where their English wasn\u2019t good, what they could do was work hard.\u201d\nSome Koreans were already skilled seamstresses when they arrived. \u201cThe Korean people, we have small hands. We are good at crafting things,\u201d Koh said. \u201cUsing hands is, I think, something we\u2019re better at somehow.\u201d \nFor Park, a typical morning begins with alterations for some of the 3,000 Navy and Air Force personnel on the base. As the only seamstress on the store\u2019s staff of six, she  works from opening at 7 a.m. to closing at 7 p.m. every day except Sunday, when the shop is closed. \nPark sews, alone, in a small room within the store that is cluttered with spare uniform regalia and scraps of fabric.  Customers trickle in and out. \u201cIt\u2019s clearly non-stop,\u201d she says. \u201cAs soon as we open, I get right into it.\u201d \nThe bell rings, and she runs out to greet a guest. \n\u201cHi, Ms. Harris, be right with you,\u201d she calls out to an older woman dressed in camouflage who stands at the front counter, her son\u2019s Air Force uniform in hand. The two exchange pleasantries, clearly familiar with each other. The exchange takes less than five minutes. And then Park returns to her area in the back, sewing an Air Force master sergeant patch onto a blue shirt.  \nHarris isn\u2019t Park\u2019s only repeat customer. Over the six years Park and her husband have operated their dry cleaners, they recognize more customers than not, she says. And though there is a dry cleaner on base, many service members choose to come to Park\u2019s shop instead, she says. \n\u201cThey go out of their way to come here and support us, which is amazing,\u201d Park says. \nSome customers aren\u2019t just repeat; they\u2019re returning after years away. One young military officer formerly stationed at Joint Base Andrews was deployed to Guam four years ago. When he returned, he came back to Top Flight Cleaners, Park says.\nThough Park\u2019s family originally comes from the Philippines, she has been connected to the Korean dry-cleaning industry for decades. When Park met her husband in a Virginia high school in 2003, she began helping at his parents\u2019 dry cleaners in Temple Hills, Maryland. Immigrants from a Seoul suburb, Park\u2019s in-laws still operate at that location. \nBy 2016, Park and her husband decided they wanted to own a shop of their own and moved to the larger location in Suitland.\nKorea-born Kim Lyle of Westfield Brite Cleaners. (Jackie DiBartolomeo/Capital News Service)\nOften, new customers assume Park is just a seamstress, not one of the owners. Despite being a mother of two college students, Park looks young for her age. She wears no makeup, and her usual work uniform is a pair of leggings and a loose T-shirt.\nDealing with rude customers is part of the job, she said. \u201cI had a customer who called in who wanted her wedding gown done. When I respectfully declined, she\u2026I don\u2019t know how to say it\u2026but I got \u2018Karen\u2019d\u2019.\u201d\n\u201cKaren\u201d is slang for someone who is hard to work with, usually a woman. When she refused to take no for an answer, the customer demanded to speak to a supervisor\u2014who turned out to be Park.\nAs the first wave of Korean immigrants began to earn more money, they broke into the dry cleaning industry, which required capital to own shops, Koh said. Dry cleaning offered other advantages, too; Many Koreans saw it as a clean and respectable business, and it offered an opportunity for a cash-only or cash-preferred business model with no credit card fees or other complications. \nWithin a decade, the Korean dry cleaning business had exploded in New York City as well. In 1978, there were about 100 Korean dry-cleaning businesses in the city. By late 1980s the 1,500, according to Kyeyoung Park, author of  \u201cThe Korean American Dream: Immigrants and Small Business in New York City.\u201d \nThough many Korean immigrants and their U.S.-born children have moved onto higher education and higher-paying jobs in greater numbers, according to the Migration Policy Institute, some Korean dry cleaners have been in the Washington area for decades. \nKim Lyle has run Westfield Brite Cleaners in Centreville, Virginia, for decades with her sister. They are of a different era than Park. Lyle was born in 1955, two years after the war ravaged the Korean peninsula, including her hometown, the western city of Suwon. \nDuring the war, Suwon was a hotbed for tensions between Northern and Southern forces; the city changed hands four times over the course of four years of war, according to the U.S. Army website.\nLyle emigrated to the West Coast and attended Lassen Community College, a small school in Susanville, California. It was a chance at a better life than the one she had in Suwon, she said.\nShe studied homemaking, sewing and alterations. In college, Lyle met her husband, currently an U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel. His job took them across the country, from California, to Hawaii, to New Jersey, before settling down in the Washington area. More than 20 years ago, Lyle opened the cleaners with her sister. \nLyle says that she has kept a fairly consistent clientele for years.\n\u201cCustomers come and go,\u201d she said, \u201cbut if you\u2019re good to them, the going won\u2019t happen.\u201d",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding Biden administration guidelines prioritizing the arrest of noncitizens who pose threats to national security or public safety, with Texas and Louisiana challenging the policy. The federal government argues that the states lack standing to sue and that the district court overstepped by blocking the guidelines nationwide.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The Supreme Court heard arguments Tuesday over Biden administration guidelines that put a priority on arresting noncitizens with criminal backgrounds or those who pose a threat to national security.\nIn September 2021, the Department of Homeland Security released immigration enforcement guidelines that prioritized the apprehension and removal of three classes of noncitizens, including those who pose a threat to national security, public safety, or border security.\nTexas and Louisiana sued to stop the guidelines; the 5th Circuit Court decided in their favor and issued an order stopping the guidelines from being implemented nationwide.\nThe federal government is calling for a reversal of that decision, arguing that the district court only had authority to grant an injunction to the parties before it, therefore pausing the guidelines in Texas and Louisiana during the legal process, rather than removing the policy entirely.\nThe Biden administration argues that the states lack standing to sue; that the district court\u2019s decision to vacate the guidelines was improper and that the new guidelines are consistent with a history of the government\u2019s prosecutorial discretion.\nStates\u2019 legal ability to sue the government based on the administration\u2019s guidelines, especially immigration policies, is a central issue in the Supreme Court case.\nThe administration argued that states did not have standing to sue because they do not suffer direct harm from the policy. Texas and Louisiana said they faced indirect impacts like increased spending on law enforcement and social services.\n\u201cGetting into the facts of this case, there was no basis in this record to show that the states will incur these indirect effects on their own taxing, spending, or regulating,\u201d said U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Progar.\nTexas Solicitor General Judd Stone argued that states take on the danger of violent crime and costs of further incarceration if certain noncitizens are not detained by DHS immediately after release from their criminal sentences.\n\u201cTexas suffers injuries regardless of what it does, whether it detains, releases or paroles individuals because not only do we have law enforcement costs, but social service costs, and very serious threats of recidivism,\u201d Stone said.\nBut Justice Elena Kagan didn\u2019t seem persuaded.\n\u201cThe fact that you are not the party directly regulated and the fact that you are challenging an enforcement action \u2013 particularly an enforcement action where the most discretion has been given to executive officials \u2013 those form the backdrop by which we should say \u2018it is just not enough that you are coming in here with a set of speculative possibilities about your costs,\u2019\u201d she said.\nKagan also worried that this case would set a dangerous precedent of states dictating federal immigration policy.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t anything that has to do with this (Biden) administration \u2013 some other administration will come in and the California solicitor general where you are,\u201d said Kagan. \u201cImmigration policy is supposed to be the zenith of federal power, and it\u2019s supposed to be the zenith of executive power. Instead we\u2019re creating a system where a combination of states and courts can bring immigration policy to a dead halt.\u201d\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson argued that the states made voluntary decisions to incarcerate noncitizens not considered threats by the federal government, making associated costs a self-inflicted injury.\nImplementing the guidelines falls on the discretion of ICE officers, who are asked to assess noncitizens based on \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d to determine whether they pose a threat to public safety\nThe guidelines build upon two existing provisions that require certain noncitizens to be detained during removal proceedings. One provision says that the DHS \u201cshall take into custody\u201d non-citizens who have committed certain offenses, while the other says that DHS \u201cshall remove\u201d and \u201cshall detain\u201d noncitizens within 90 days of a filing of a removal order.\nThe justices spent time Tuesday discussing the meaning of \u201cshall.\u201d\nProgar contended that \u201cshall\u201d cannot be interpreted literally. Expecting the DHS to apprehend, detain and remove all 11 million undocumented immigrants would be impossible given the agency\u2019s current allocated resources, she said.\n\u201cIt is impossible for DHS to comply with each and every \u2018shall\u2019 in the (Immigration and Nationality Act),\u201d Progar said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the resources or ability to go after those individuals who are threats to public safety, national security and border security. That is a senseless way to run an immigration enforcement system and it\u2019s not the statute Congress enacted.\u201d\nChief Justice John Roberts pushed back.\n\u201cWhen we get to the merits, I think \u2018shall\u2019 means \u2018shall,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to say what the law is, not whether or not it can be possibly implemented or whether there are difficulties there, and I don\u2019t think we should change that responsibility because Congress and the executive can\u2019t agree on something that is possible to address this problem.\u201d",

You know, we were declared essential during the pandemic, provided we had staffing, but it\u2019s very, very difficult to operate like this,\u201d said Brooks, who is also the co-owner of J.M. Clayton Seafood Company.\nFor years, Brooks said, employers in the seafood industry have struggled to obtain enough H-2B visas \u2013 temporary nonagricultural worker permits \u2013 to properly staff crab and seafood businesses.\u00a0\nLast month, Maryland Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, both Democrats, announced a visa program for the 2023 fiscal year that aims to temporarily aid the staffing shortage.\u00a0\nThe Department of Homeland Security will provide 130,716 H-2B visas in the 2023 fiscal year, made up of 66,000 that are annually released and 64,716 additional visas. Cardin and Van Hollen said in a statement that they are seeking a permanent solution to the lack of visas in the H-2B program.\u00a0\n\u201cThe success of our small seafood businesses \u2013 and the strength of our Shore economy \u2013 depends on their ability to hire enough workers for crabbing season,\u201d Van Hollen said in a statement to CNS. \u201cThis year the H-2B process is better than it has been previously, but it is certainly not a long-term solution.\u201d\nThe move to add more visas comes after Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, urged lawmakers to find a solution to the limitations of the H-2B visa cap.\u00a0\n\u201cMaryland\u2019s seafood industry is part of what makes us known around the nation and the world. We cannot \u2013 and I will not \u2013 let these hardworking Maryland businesses fail on our watch,\u201d Hogan said in a Feb. 15 letter to Maryland lawmakers.\nAt the start of the crab-picking season, seafood processors are awarded H-2B visas through a lottery system, competing with other industries for temporary workers.\u00a0\nNine out of 10 crab processors said that challenges in labor availability threatened the survival of seafood businesses, according to a project conducted by the Chesapeake Bay Seafood Industry Association and supported by the Maryland Department of Agriculture. Many of the processors also said the current lottery system creates uncertainty and hurts the industry.\n\u201cWe need a long term fix,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cThe release of the supplemental visas sounds really good but it won\u2019t come anywhere near satisfying the demand.\u201d",

The administration plans to end the so-called \u201cremain in Mexico\u201d policy next month, reversing a 2019 decision by then-President Donald Trump to stop asylum-seekers at the southern border from entering the United States.\n\u201cThis policy does not protect people from seeking asylum.\u00a0Instead, it puts people seeking refuge and protection in more\u00a0danger,\u201d Ray Rodr\u00edguez, who was forced to wait in Mexico for 10\u00a0months, told the rally.\n\u201cSeeking asylum is a human right,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said. \u201cNo human should be forced to remain in danger in Mexico while waiting for asylum claims.

The bill aims to correct the unequal application of the current Probation Before Judgment law and ensure equal justice for both citizens and noncitizens.",
    "content": "ANNAPOLIS \u2013 Under Maryland law, first-time, nonviolent offenders of relatively minor crimes can plead guilty and receive probation, and after a successful completion, go on without the burden of a criminal conviction haunting the rest of their lives.\nNot so for immigrants in the state. In order to receive probation, they must plead guilty to a crime, which for them can lead to deportation or make them ineligible to receive a green card or to become a citizen.\nState legislators, advocates and prosecutors, including the Maryland Attorney General, agree that the 47-year-old law, which has given thousands of Maryland residents a second chance, unfairly harms immigrants including those who are lawfully living and working in the state, immigrants brought to the country as children, so-called \u201cDreamers\u201d protected under the federal Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, and undocumented residents.\nSen. Susan C. Lee, D-Montgomery, and Del. Wanika B. Fisher, D-Prince George\u2019s, are sponsoring legislation titled Probation Not Deportation (SB0265/HB0559) that would amend the state statute, called Probation Before Judgment, so immigrants would not be vulnerable to further penalties.\nThe Senate took up the bill this week and the House of Delegates will hold a hearing Feb.15.\n\u201cThe current PBJ law unintentionally created an unequal application for citizens and noncitizens, and this bill is largely a technical fix to achieve equal justice\u201d Lee, the lead sponsor on the bill, said Wednesday during a hearing on the legislation before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee.\nThe provision adds a method for a judge to grant immigrants probation without having them plead guilty during the sentencing process. Advocates, including criminal justice officials, said it will not erode the original method of obtaining probation.\nFederal immigration law interprets probation as a conviction,because the person pled guilty to a crime and that can lead to harsh consequences the bill is designed to eliminate.\nDuring the hearing, witnesses said the federal immigration policy undermines the intent of PBJ but can be fixed at the state level by making probation not a conviction under state and federal laws.\nThey also said the law disproportionately impacts people of color. Attorney Emily Jones from Capital Area Immigrants\u2019 Rights Coalition, an organization representing immigrants in detention, said that more than a half of her clients were detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement after having contact with the criminal system and almost 99% of them are Black or brown.\nSome senators are concerned, however, that the bill could constitute a violation of due process of the Maryland Constitution.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t put people on probation unless you have them plead guilty,\u201d Sen. Michael Hough, R-Frederick and Carroll, said during the hearing.\nAdvocates and criminal law experts countered that the provision would only pause the finding of guilt, acknowledging that the facts of guilt exist.\nThe state\u2019s attorneys for Caroline and Montgomery counties testified in favor of the bill during the hearing and the committee received a letter of support from the Attorney General\u2019s office.\nThe letter said the bill \u201cwill help avoid devastating immigration consequences for people who commit minor crimes.\u201d\nIn an interview with the Capital News Service, Gabriela Kahrl, a lawyer and associate director at the Chacon Center for Immigrant Law in the University of Maryland-Baltimore, said the change in the law would \u201ccreate equal opportunity to probation for every Marylander, regardless of whether they are a U.S. citizen or not.\u201d\n\u00a0\u201cThe person is not getting anything other than the failure to trigger the federal immigration statute that considers it a conviction,\u201d Kahrl said.\nJanice Alonzo, an academic advisor and adjunct faculty member at Community College of Baltimore County, told legislators Wednesday she worries that a family member under DACA protection could be deported after being placed on probation for driving under the influence of alcohol two years ago.\nThe man has completed alcohol counseling classes and is working to pay the court-ordered fine, Alonzo said. A deportation would tear his family apart, she told the committee.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve cried and are very worried about the fact that this family member could be sent back home because of his one night mistake,\u201d she said.\nThe current law has devastating consequences for people who oftentimes are offenders of small crimes including theft, drug possession or a dispute, said John F. Gossart, a former U.S. immigration judge who also testified at the hearing.\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about individuals who have made a mistake, recognized their mistakes, and are willing to rehabilitate themselves,\u201d Gossart, a judge with the Baltimore Immigration Court for 31 years, told Capital News Service in an interview.\nHe is a member of the Board of Directors for the Immigration Law Section with the Federal Bar Association, a voluntary organization for private and government lawyers and judges practicing law in a federal court.\nGossart said over his career he had no choice but to issue deportation orders for more than a hundred immigrants who had received probation. The law did not permit him to give them a second chance even if he thought they deserved one, he said.\nHe recalled deporting a permanent resident on probation, a father of two U.S. citizens and a homeowner who Gossart described as a decent and good person.\n\u201cNone of that counted,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no choice. I was correct under the law, but I did not do justice that day,\u201d he said.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Thousands of Afghan evacuees have resettled into the United States, but the temporary nature of their legal status could hinder their adjustment to the country now and in the coming years, experts say.\nThe U.S. withdrawal of troops and the Taliban\u2019s takeover in Afghanistan forced hundreds of thousands of Afghan people to flee their country in August.\nThousands of Afghan evacuees initially came to military bases in the United States, where they received screenings, security clearances, vaccinations and health care.\u00a0\nAnd thousands of other Afghan evacuees \u2014 many of them hoping to eventually resettle in the United States \u2014 were also relocated to American military bases around the world.\u00a0\nSome still eagerly wait to leave Afghanistan.\nThe stopgap government spending bill signed by President Joe Biden last week included $7 billion for four federal agencies to help in relocating Afghan refugees.\u00a0\nMany Afghan evacuee families who initially arrived to military bases in the United States are just now being relocated to resettlement agencies across the country, according to Stephen Carattini, president and CEO of Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Arlington.\u00a0\nThe Arlington diocese has helped resettle hundreds of Afghan evacuees and anticipates hundreds more in the coming weeks, providing services including workforce preparation, mental health counseling, free medical clinics and legal immigration consultations.\u00a0\nThe majority of Afghan evacuees arrive here under humanitarian parole status, which only entitles them to two years of temporary legal protection, a situation that can hinder their housing and work opportunities.\u00a0\n\u201cThese individuals\u00a0\u2014\u00a0we do not want (them) to go home; we want them to stay; they\u2019re political refugees, essentially, who helped us in our foreign policy fights, yet the legal status doesn\u2019t allow them to plan the future with any type of certainty,\u201d said Stewart Verdery, who served under President George W. Bush as assistant secretary for border and transportation security policy and planning at the Department of Homeland Security.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWe have other people who come to the United States (who) are designed to be temporary workers, or they\u2019re visiting temporarily, and they\u2019re supposed to go home; this is not the case here,\u201d said Verdery, who is also a member of the Council on National Security and Immigration and the CEO and founder of Monument Advocacy, a bipartisan consulting firm.\u00a0\u00a0\nAn \u201cAfghan Adjustment Act\u201d could provide a more long-term solution for Afghan evacuees in a state of limbo because of the temporary nature of their humanitarian parole status, according to Verdery.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty simple legal change; it just basically provides them a place in line for a green card that currently they don\u2019t have as being admitted on parole, which doesn\u2019t provide you any legal status,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nAnd some organizations, such as the International Refugee Assistance Project, are advocating for Congress to take action that would provide a more long-term solution to Afghan evacuees\u2019 uncertain legal status.\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been pushing for an act of Congress that would provide that kind of blanket adjustment of status for folks who came in as part of the evacuation and were paroled into the United States, to have their status adjusted so that they have a long-term durable status,\u201d said Elizabeth Foydel, private sponsorship program director for the International Refugee Assistance Project.\u00a0\nThe nonprofit, based in New York City, provides legal aid for refugees and other forcibly displaced people around the world and pushes for immigration policy changes at the federal level.\u00a0\n\u201cBut the challenges haven\u2019t ended since the formal U.S. withdrawal concluded,\u201d Foydel said, who also emphasized the legal challenges for those still living in Afghanistan.\u00a0\n\u201cSo, over the past couple of months since, there (have) been\u2026clients and family members in Afghanistan for whom we\u2019re trying to think through long-term solutions, and\u2026.we still have a significant amount of advocacy around evacuation, as well as what\u2019s happening to the folks who are evacuated once they evacuated,\u201d Foydel said.\u00a0\nThe temporary legal protections for Afghan evacuees can also create additional barriers toward securing affordable housing.\u00a0\n\u201cWhat\u2019s unusual in our case is that\u2026because of the lack of affordable housing in the area\u2026only people with primary ties can ask to be resettled in Northern Virginia,\u201d Carattini said. The region has a significant Afghan community.\u00a0\n\u201cIf (Afghan evacuees) do not have a primary tie in the United States, then they are assigned to resettlement agencies in parts of the country where there is more available housing and employment,\u201d Carattini said.\u00a0\nSarah Sheffer, senior communications adviser for Welcome.US, said finding affordable housing has been a challenge for the Afghan evacuees they have assisted.\u00a0\nWelcome.US is a broad coalition that began in September to support the resettlement of Afghan evacuees in the United States.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are welcoming tens of thousands of newcomers into our communities at a point when our resettlement infrastructure\u2026has been substantially diminished,\u201d Sheffer said.\u00a0\n\u201cAnd we are facing things all Americans are facing, like a shortage of affordable housing, and we know that\u2019s being coupled with the difficulty of renting to families who have no credit history coming into the United States, so housing has been a really critical challenge to getting people off bases and into homes that are suitable and safe,\u201d Sheffer said.\u00a0\nBut local resettlement agencies are looking for ways to tackle affordable housing issues for Afghan evacuees.\u00a0\nThe Maryland-based Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service has partnered with the rental company Airbnb. The organization also educates landlords to better understand the Afghan evacuees who are adjusting to life in a completely new environment.\u00a0\nSince Afghan evacuees arrived, many have had to endure separation from their family and friends who remain in Afghanistan.\u00a0\nThe evacuees chaotically rushed out of Afghanistan without any time for proper goodbyes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen many husbands and wives where the husband is here, but the wife is still in Kabul or the other way around, or grandparents\u2026there\u2019s a lot of concern for family members (who) are left behind, whether or not and when they will see them again, so it was not an orderly departure,\u201d Carattini said.\u00a0\n\u201cIt was not (as if) everyone had time to get their affairs in order, say their goodbyes and even the idea that \u2018hey, we\u2019ll come back and visit you kind of thing\u2019 \u2014 none of that happened,\u201d he said.\nAnd some evacuees in the United States with family members left behind in Afghanistan might be worried about their loved ones facing retribution from the Taliban, according to Krish O\u2019Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service.\nThe organization has resettled nearly 200 Afghan humanitarian parolees and 60 Afghan Special Immigrant Visa holders since the initial evacuation and expects to resettle roughly 2,500 more parolees in Maryland.\n\u201cI think one concern is just making sure that we can help \u2014 not just provide a roof over (evacuees\u2019) heads and food in their fridges\u00a0\u2014 but also trauma-informed care that recognizes the psychological and emotional kind of turmoil that they\u2019ve been through,\u201d Vignarajah said.\nThousands more Afghan evacuees at U.S. military bases abroad are expected to arrive in the United States in the coming months, in addition to those still living in Afghanistan.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s never easy to be a refugee; it\u2019s never easy to be displaced (and) find yourself in a new place,\u201d Carattini said. \u201cAnd then to have done this through COVID \u2014 it\u2019s really, really hard.\u201d",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 A new Governor\u2019s Office for Immigrant Affairs is tasked with connecting immigrant advocacy resources across the state to those in need, and Maryland\u2019s nonprofits and high-ranking officials have thrown in their support \u2014 and expectations.\nBills SB85 and HB15, which chartered the office on Oct. 1, require that its administrators form a network of existing immigrant advocacy groups across the state to share resources, as well as to pass along information about government programs and to advise Gov. Larry Hogan, R, on immigrant needs.\nThe main goals for the office, according to the bills, are to help with career placement, English language programs and naturalization processes for Marylanders who are foreign-born, about 15% of the population, according to an August 2020 American Immigration Council report.\nThe bill also requires the office to configure a website and a multilingual hotline for finding services and referrals, as well as for reporting fraud and crime against immigrants, which they are to forward to police authorities.\nLorena Rivera was appointed on Oct. 1 as director of the new office, which is housed under the Governor\u2019s Office of Community Initiatives.\nRivera is also the director for the governor\u2019s Hispanic Commission under the same department, which she has been involved with since 2015, working on both census data collection and COVID-19 aid access.\nFirst on Rivera\u2019s to-do list is planning site visits for nonprofits and stakeholders to scope out available resources for the immigrant advocacy group network, she said.\nRivera told Capital News Service that her main goals are to complete the website and hotline before a new governor potentially appoints a new director in 15 months.\nShe could not give a timeline for the completion of either tool except that the website is currently underway.\nDetails about hiring the other three required staff, a legal adviser and two administrative assistants, were also still hazy, but she said their hiring depends on her workload and whether she\u2019ll need extra help completing her duties.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really up to my superiors on what they want to do,\u201d she said, \u201cBut we\u2019re still very early, very early.\u201d\nRivera said she feels very comfortable forming partnerships for the advocacy network.\n\u201cEveryone knows who all the players are, who the nonprofits are. We all work together on a daily basis, you know \u2014 they have events, they all invite one another. So we\u2019re all connected.\u201d\nShe said some fledgling advocacy groups might not be linked in yet, but are slowly reaching out to her.\nShe said forming partnerships with new and existing groups would be \u201cvery easy\u201d for her, drawing on her background of media and marketing.\nRivera is a daughter of immigrants from El Salvador and recalled being a little girl translating for her parents when they lived in Washington, D.C.\n\u201cI remember my parents asking me, because they didn\u2019t speak English, \u2018How do I get my driver\u2019s license?\u2019 And I remember having to call and ask for them.\u201d\nIn 2021, she said, it\u2019s much easier to find the information, but not necessarily in an individual\u2019s own language.\n\u201cThat, I\u2019m truly excited about,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause back then it was so hard.\u201d\nNow, she said, she can connect people to resources multilingually and \u201cbe able to show people what our state has to offer.\u201d\nIn the harsh sun, people huddle under shady trees with signs that read, \u201cDACA is the 1st step,\u201d \u201cImmigrants Built America,\u201d and \u201cBridges Not Walls\u201d at CASA\u2019s march for citizenship in Washington Sept. 21, 2021. Trisha Ahmed/Capital News Service\nBill sponsor Del. Joseline Pena-Melnyk, D-Prince George\u2019s and Anne Arundel, said the idea for a state-level immigrant affairs office sprang from need exacerbated by the pandemic.\n\u201cI started getting calls from everywhere, even from my colleagues across the aisle, all of them asking \u2014 \u2018What are the services available to the immigrant community?'\u201d Pena-Melnyk said in an interview this month.\nWhen no such list arose, Pena-Melnyk said she collaborated on what she called a \u201cbrown paper,\u201d a list of services in Spanish stretching from abuse hotlines to fair housing assistance, from legal help to resources for unemployment.\n\u201cBut it\u2019s all piecemeal,\u201d the delegate said. The bill requires the immigrant affairs office to connect all these services together under one umbrella and remove language and access barriers to each.\nBut Pena-Melnyk had some concerns. The bill went into effect without Hogan\u2019s signature and was instituted under his Community Initiatives office instead of at the cabinet level as the delegate had intended.\n\u201cI hope they can budget to do all the bill requires,\u201d she said.\nThe bill sets aside more than $321,000 initially, with increases every year to cover salary raises and the cost of turnover, up to $400,000 in 2026.\nThe first year, almost $256,000 is assigned for salaries and benefits and nearly $21,000 is assigned to operating expenses. Ongoing hotline and website costs ring in at $38,000 for the year, and one-time technology set-up costs are set at $6,500.\n\u201cTo enhance, enrich someone\u2019s life, help them get educated and work and contribute \u2014 their life is worth much more than $400k by itself,\u201d Pena-Melnyk stressed.\nResidents and organizations from across Maryland spoke out against the creation of the immigrant affairs office at hearings in February.\nAt least seven witnesses called the office a \u201cmagnet\u201d for more illegal immigration to Maryland. At least five called it unfair that services would be provided to a small sector of Marylanders on what at least six called a \u201cstrained\u201d state budget, out of 10 written opposition testimonies recorded for both bills on the Maryland General Assembly\u2019s website.\nAt the time of the hearing, Hogan had just signed the $1 billion RELIEF Act of 2021 releasing COVID-19 aid to Marylanders due to fiscal stress. This month, a $2.5 billion surplus was announced in the state\u2019s general fund from the past fiscal year.\nOther opponents called the office duplicative when other state agencies already exist, like the Maryland Office for Refugees and Asylees in the state\u2019s Department of Human Services.\nAccording to that agency\u2019s website, however, its services are for \u201cfederally recognized refugees and political asylees\u201d only.\nA representative from the Maryland Federation of Republican Women said, \u201cWhile it is a noble goal and desire to help all residents of Maryland, spending more Maryland tax dollars and creating more bureaucracy does not seem the best way to accomplish this task.\u201d\nProponents of the immigrant affairs office include high-level Democrats, including candidate for governor Comptroller Peter Franchot and Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh.\nA program director for the Esperanza Center, an immigrant resource center Catholic Charities runs in Baltimore, said in testimony that a state-level office would mimic the support the center has received since 2014 from the Baltimore Mayor\u2019s Office for Immigrant Affairs, ensuring programs are accessible and equitable.\nA representative from CASA, which he called the largest immigrant advocacy group active in Maryland, said in testimony in January that a state-level office would have \u201ctremendous positive impact on immigrant families in Maryland who still lack basic language access, experience exploitation in a variety of different spaces, maintain distrust of the government and more.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 As a number of top American companies are promising to train or hire Afghan refugees resettling in the United States, questions remain about providing child-care services to the new workers.\nThe infusion of new talent should help offset nationwide labor shortages, said Krish O\u2019Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Baltimore-based Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services.\n\u201cThese refugees are such vital contributors to our economy and workforce,\u201d Vignarajah said to CNS. \u201cJust because these people have been persecuted doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t coming with valuable skills.\u201d\nMaryland is slated to receive 1,348 refugees recently evacuated from Afghanistan, according to government statistics first reported by The Associated Press.\nThe odds of those refugees finding work are good: 61 percent of those in Maryland using employment services landed jobs in 2020, according to the Maryland Office for Refugees and Asylees. The state is ranked eleventh in employment outcomes for refugees nationwide.\nBut child care is absolutely going to be essential, said Alan Khazei, senior advisor at Welcome.US, a national coalition to welcome and support the incoming Afghan refugees through employment opportunities.\nAfghan families are very large, said Freshta Taeb, a board member of the Afghan American Foundation and senior refugee interventionist for Cornerstone family and marriage intervention, a faith-based counseling organization.\n\u201cThe biggest help any organization can have when hiring women is going to be the option of childcare,\u201d said Taeb, who has been working with Afghan refugees at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey, one of the primary entry points for Afghan refugees coming to the United States.\nIn July, The Economist evaluated countries with the most generous child-care policies, including leave, access, quality and affordability. America ranked number 40 out of 41 countries on the list.\nChild care is an issue Welcome.US is trying to work on, Khazei said. However, he admitted that providing and funding child care will largely depend on volunteers stepping up and helping out, he said.\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had this many refugees arriving all at once since the end of the Vietnam War, so it\u2019s a huge challenge,\u201d Khazei said.\nIn addition to companies and nonprofits, 16 governors joined Welcome.US, including Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam.\n\u201cOur state is proud to be the fourth state in the nation for the resettlement of SIV recipients,\u201d Governor Larry Hogan said during the livestream launch of Welcome.US on Sept. 14.\nA 2018 Migration Policy Institute report revealed early childhood services for young refugee children are a low-priority issue and are often overlooked by both state and federal agencies, policymakers and departments responsible for refugee resettlement and integration.\nThe majority of the $6.3 billion in emergency funds the Biden administration received from Congress to help Afghan refugees will go to the Defense and and State Departments to support processing sites and transportation to and from those sites, Shalanda Young, acting director of the White House\u2019s Office of Management and Budget, wrote in a blog post.\nAdditional funds will go to health screenings, vaccinations and resettlement resources, Young said. Taeb said she has not seen Afghan refugee families coming to the base with fewer than six, seven or eight children.\nMany of the women Taeb is seeing and interacting with on the base are pregnant, she said, adding that there have been over a dozen babies born so far at the New Jersey installation.\nWorking married mothers in the United States often reduce work hours, take pay cuts or drop out of the workforce altogether so that they can take care of their children, according to a 2021 study by the U.S. Census bureau.\nMaryland\u2019s refugee office has served 465 newly-arrived eligible Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) applicants as of August 2021. The Special Immigrant Visa program is one of many programs authorizing Afghan refugees to resettle in the United States.\nAs of 2020, a report from Brown University\u2019s Watson Institute said, over 18,000 Afghan applicants had received American government visas, along with over 45,000 of their immediate family members, and had immigrated to the United States.\nApplicants for SIVs must meet certain requirements like working for or with the U.S. government in some capacity.\nBetween Oct. 1, 2020, and the end of last month, 330 Afghan SIV\u2019s arrived in Maryland, according to data from the Refugee Processing Center, a case management system processing refugees in the United States.\nMost women in Afghanistan are not eligible for the SIV program, said Devon Cone, a senior advocate for women and girls at Refugees International.\nCone said women have a hard time qualifying as primary SIV applicants because they had limited access to education and, even if able to work with the U.S. military, would have faced much higher personal risks in Afghanistan simply because they were women.\nHowever, there are some Afghan women who have come to the United States through the SIV program but will face other challenges.\nDeterrents around child care and transportation made it difficult for Afghan and Iraqi female Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) spouses to attend classes or employment, according to a 2018 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the nonpartisan auditing arm of Congress.\nFemale SIV spouses who wanted to work felt they needed to wait until their children were older or needed to learn the English language first, the GAO said.\nAmong other programs, child care and language adaptation are vital to the integration of refugees in the work environment, according to 2019 documents released by the International Chamber of Commerce.\nThe United States Chamber of Commerce Foundation earlier this month launched a coalition to help Afghan refugees find employment in the United States. The coalition also joined the Welcome.US campaign working with companies like UPS, Amazon and Walmart to offer assistance to Afghan refugees.\n\u201c\u2026We know what a job means to an individual and to a community. It means dignity, opportunity, stability and hope for a better future,\u201d Carolyn Cawley, president of the chamber\u2019s foundation, said in a statement.\nTo ensure that their new workers stay employed, companies need to understand what skills Afghan refugees already possess and learn about Afghan culture, Taeb said.\nAnother challenge will be helping refugees adjust to American culture, Taeb said.\n\u201cIf employees are not culturally competent or not aware of certain dynamics, you can\u2019t expect someone from a different culture to come and assimilate overnight,\u201d Taeb said.\n[Like what you\u2019re reading?

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 A widespread coalition of political, religious and business leaders, joined by numerous large companies and advocacy organizations, on Tuesday launched an effort to help Afghan evacuees resettle in the United States.\nThe new group, called Welcome.US, seeks to engage the American public in welcoming Afghan refugees in a multifaceted effort, Cecelia Mu\u00f1oz, the initiative\u2019s co-founder, said at a virtual press conference. The former director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under President Barack Obama, she is senior adviser to New America, a public policy group.\nThe initiative will try to make it easier for Americans to donate to frontline organizations and sponsor Afghan families arriving in the United States.\n\u201cWelcome.US is being launched in response to this outpouring from the American people to channel and fan its flames, building on the extraordinary work so many tireless frontline organizations have been leading,\u201d co-founder John Bridgeland said. He was director of the White House Domestic Policy Council under President George W. Bush. He is president and CEO of Civic Enterprises, a public policy firm.\nAfghan-American organizations, faith-based groups, resettlement agencies, businesses, veterans, nonprofits, universities and political leaders have joined the initiative.\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan also expressed his support for Welcome.US, urging Marylanders to help Afghan evacuees resettling in this country through donating money to frontline organizations, hosting families or providing essential services.\n\u201cWhen America began its withdrawal from Afghanistan, I made it clear that Maryland was ready and willing to welcome these Afghan allies,\u201d Hogan said at the press conference.\nHogan also spoke of America\u2019s history of compassion and commitment to helping others.\n\u201cToday, we\u2019re calling on that spirit of compassion yet again,\u201d Hogan said. \u201cThe thousands of Afghan allies, who desperately need our help now, have been our strong allies for the past two decades.\u201d\nWelcome.US\u2019s co-chairs include Obama, Bush and former President Bill Clinton, as well as former first ladies Michelle Obama, Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton.\n\u201cMany of the refugees fleeing Afghanistan stood by America and risked everything for a chance at a better life,\u201d Obama tweeted. \u201cWith the launch of Welcome.US, we can support our new Afghan neighbors and reaffirm our common humanity. I hope you\u2019ll join us.\u201d\nWelcome.US\u2019s launch comes during a pivotal moment in Afghan-American relations. The withdrawal of American troops and the Taliban\u2019s control in Afghanistan left hundreds of thousands of Afghan allies struggling to escape and find new places to call home.\nThe initiative also begins shortly after the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.\n\u201cBut this call to action transcends the toxic politics of the moment, and I ask all Marylanders \u2013 and all Americans \u2013 to help us prove once again why this nation truly is \u2018the last best hope of earth,\u2019\u201d Hogan said.\nPotential congressional legislation aimed at helping Afghan evacuees could affect the impact of Welcome.US.\n\u201cCongress has some serious work to do to make this success possible,\u201d said Nazanin Ash, the International Rescue Committee\u2019s vice president of global policy and advocacy.\nAsh pointed to the Biden administration\u2019s request for funding and authority on extending refugee benefits to Afghan evacuees and providing them a path to permanent legal residency in the United States.\n\u201cWithout this assistance, Afghan evacuees will not be able to access healthcare, language services or secure other public and private benefits that will help them find their footing and get a leg up in their new country,\u201d Ash said.",

Al ser considerados trabajadores esenciales, pueden continuar trabajando incluso si entran en contacto con alguien que tiene el virus.\nEl Departamento del Trabajo de Estados Unidos, que regula el programa H-2B, no estableci\u00f3 medidas de seguridad para los trabajadores que viajan en bus a trav\u00e9s de la frontera durante la pandemia de COVID-19. Maryland, Virginia y Carolina del Norte, estados con prol\u00edficas industrias pesqueras que dependen de los trabajadores migrantes con visa H-2B, tampoco garantizaron las medidas necesarias para protegerlos.\nEntre octubre del 2019 y septiembre del 2020, se autorizaron m\u00e1s de 12000 visas H-2B para trabajadores de las industrias del marisco en los Estados Unidos, incluyendo 2232 visas para 41 compa\u00f1\u00edas a lo largo de estos tres estados, de acuerdo con un an\u00e1lisis del Howard Center for Investigative Journalism de la Universidad de Maryland.\nUna pizarra en la compa\u00f1\u00eda Lindy\u2019s Seafood muestra los precios del cangrejo.

Un an\u00e1lisis del Howard Center encontr\u00f3 que, de esas quejas, 32 fueron contra procesadoras de marisco. Esta industria contrata m\u00e1s trabajadores migrantes con visa H-2B que ninguna otra, a excepci\u00f3n de la jardiner\u00eda.\n\u201cSi se quejan en represalia podr\u00edan ser despedidos y perder su estatus legal en los Estados Unidos\u201d, dijo Clermont Ripley, abogado del North Carolina Justice Center, una organizaci\u00f3n sin fines de lucro. \u201cEs esta mano de obra cautiva la que va a soportar una buena cantidad de violaciones a sus derechos para poder seguir trabajando legalmente\u201d.\nSin est\u00e1ndares y regulaciones gubernamentales, la decisi\u00f3n sobre c\u00f3mo mantener a los trabajadores seguros durante esta pandemia depende en gran medida de los empleadores.\nA la mayor\u00eda \u201cde verdad les importa y quieren mantener a todos seguros\u201d, dijo Lydia Hock, cofundadora de Labormex LLC que ha reclutado trabajadores con visa H-2B para la industria del marisco.\n\u201cSi un trabajador no se siente seguro, obviamente no tiene que venir\u201d, a\u00f1adi\u00f3. \u201cHay millones de personas en M\u00e9xico que quieren estas oportunidades\u201d.\nLa inacci\u00f3n federal marca la pauta\nCada temporada, los trabajadores migrantes con visa H-2B viajan desde sus hogares en M\u00e9xico a una de las siete ciudades del pa\u00eds donde el consulado estadounidense procesa y aprueba sus visas. Despu\u00e9s, compa\u00f1\u00edas de transporte los trasladan a sus diferentes lugares de trabajo en Estados Unidos.\nEstos trabajadores corren el riesgo de contraer COVID-19 en cada etapa del proceso.\nA veces esperan d\u00edas, hasta semanas, para que sus visas sean procesadas. Lejos de su hogar, se alojan en hoteles, donde varias personas comparten una habitaci\u00f3n\u2014 lo que puede ser riesgoso durante una pandemia.\nUna vez que sus visas han sido aprobadas, estos trabajadores viajan hacia los Estados Unidos. Seg\u00fan la ley federal, los empleadores deben pagar por la transportaci\u00f3n de sus trabajadores, que a veces se coordina con agencias que reclutan trabajadores H-2B.\nTrabajadores migrantes con visa H-2B le contaron al Howard Center sobre sus experiencias al viajar por miles de kil\u00f3metros en un bus lleno de personas en septiembre y dormir en una van con m\u00e1s de doce trabajadores por dos noches en enero de este a\u00f1o.\nEs muy com\u00fan que al llegar, los trabajadores compartan viviendas ofertadas por sus empleadores, quienes cobran una tarifa semanal por el alojamiento. Algunos empiezan a trabajar al d\u00eda siguiente de llegar.\nEmpleados de Lindy\u2019s est\u00e1n parados en el muelle de carga en abril. Cincuenta y nueve trabajadores migrantes con visa H-2B llegaron en bus desde M\u00e9xico el d\u00eda anterior. A pesar de su largo viaje en medio de la pandemia, fueron a trabajar al d\u00eda siguiente sin que se les realice una prueba de COVID-19 y sin hacer cuarentena. Estas medidas de seguridad no son requeridas a nivel estatal ni federal. (Cr\u00e9dito: Carmen Molina Acosta/Universidad de Maryland)\nEl Departamento del Trabajo de Estados Unidos no ha emitido ning\u00fan protocolo de seguridad para proteger del COVID-19 a los trabajadores migrantes que viajan en bus hacia Estados Unidos, confirm\u00f3 Edwin Nieves, representante de la agencia. Tampoco existen requerimientos para hacerles una prueba de COVID-19 cuando han llegado o mientras est\u00e1n en tr\u00e1nsito.\nEstos vac\u00edos en el sistema regulatorio impulsaron a que organizaciones de defensa de los trabajadores migrantes \u2014incluidos el Centro de los Derechos del Migrante, North Carolina Justice Center y el Southern Poverty Law Center\u2014 enviaran una carta a las agencias federales cruciales para pedir acciones inmediatas para proteger a los trabajadores.\nLa carta recomendaba a los departamentos de Trabajo, Estado, Salud y Servicios Humanos y Seguridad Nacional tomar medidas para prevenir aglomeraciones innecesarias cerca de los consulados, transportar a los trabajadores en buses a medio llenar y acomodarlos en habitaciones individuales durante su viaje.\nTambi\u00e9n incluy\u00f3 un llamado a que OSHA inspeccionara que las viviendas compartidas cumplan con medidas de seguridad para prevenir la transmisi\u00f3n del COVID-19, que los trabajadores provean una licencia por enfermedad pagada y coordinen el acceso a atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica para los trabajadores con visa H-2B durante la pandemia.\nNinguna de estas recomendaciones fueron aprobadas. La ley que requer\u00eda garantizar licencia por enfermedad pagada a los trabajadores, incluidos los H-2B, expir\u00f3 en diciembre del a\u00f1o pasado. El Howard Center encontr\u00f3 que Maryland, Virginia y Carolina del Norte tampoco establecieron protecciones para los trabajadores migrantes con visa H-2B, cuyos defensores dicen son necesarias para garantizar su seguridad.\nBrotes de coronavirus se propagan en los tres estados\nEn septiembre, \u201cSantiago\u201d\u2014 un trabajador migrante con visa H-2B quien pidi\u00f3 al Howard Center ser identificado con un seud\u00f3nimo por temor a perder su trabajo en Bonums Oyster Company Inc, ubicada en Kinsale, Virginia \u2014 abord\u00f3 un bus lleno con alrededor de cuarenta trabajadores migrantes con visa H-2B en Monterrey, M\u00e9xico.\nViajaron un d\u00eda y medio para llegar a su trabajo. \u201cSantiago\u201d describi\u00f3 tomar precauciones en el bus al usar un cubrebocas y gel sanitizante, pero record\u00f3 no poder practicar los dos metros de distanciamiento para separarse de sus compa\u00f1eros.\nDos d\u00edas despu\u00e9s de llegar a Virginia, la compa\u00f1\u00eda Bonums llev\u00f3 a los trabajadores a hacerse una prueba de COVID-19 en una cl\u00ednica, dijo \u201cSantiago\u201d.

Esperaron por dos d\u00edas en el consulado de Estados Unidos hasta recibir sus visas. Luego, viajaron a trav\u00e9s del pa\u00eds durmiendo por dos d\u00edas dentro de la van.\nDespu\u00e9s de llegar al pueblo de Aurora, M\u00f3nica dijo que fue transferida a una vivienda para trabajadores migrantes, donde la compa\u00f1\u00eda le cobra una tarifa semanal por alojamiento. Despu\u00e9s de dos d\u00edas, ocup\u00f3 su lugar en la l\u00ednea de procesamiento sin que se le haga una prueba de COVID-19.\nLa empresa no nos hizo un test, dijo, \u201chasta que ya hubo casos\u201d.\nSus primeros s\u00edntomas aparecieron dentro de tres semanas.

Hubiera exigido que los empleadores ofrecieran viviendas separadas a los trabajadores que dieron positivo a las pruebas de COVID-19 y garantizaran medidas de seguridad en el trabajo, en las viviendas para migrantes y en el transporte. Tambi\u00e9n habr\u00eda requerido que el Departamento de Trabajo de Maryland inspeccionara las viviendas de los migrantes durante la pandemia para garantizar que sean seguras.\nEl proyecto de ley no pas\u00f3 el comit\u00e9 legislativo en febrero de este a\u00f1o.\n\n\n\nEn el pueblo costanero de Kinsale en Virginia, Roland y Shirley Bevans recibieron el a\u00f1o pasado aprobaci\u00f3n federal para contratar a 110 empacadores de cebo y mariscos, 130 procesadores de ostiones y 14 procesadores de mariscos con visa H-2B en las marisqueras mayoristas Bevans Oyster Company Inc. y Bonums Oyster Company Inc.\nLa agencia estatal designada por OSHA en Virginia, VOSH (Agencia de Salud y Seguridad Ocupacional de Virginia) recibi\u00f3 una queja en contra de Bevans el julio pasado.\nLa compa\u00f1\u00eda no aplic\u00f3 medidas de distanciamiento ni en el trabajo ni en las viviendas para los migrantes, dec\u00eda la queja, y los trabajadores que dieron positivo no fueron aislados de acuerdo con los protocolos del Centro de Control y Prevenci\u00f3n de Enfermedades, por lo que habr\u00edan puesto en riesgo de contraer y transmitir el COVID-19 a otros.\nRegistros oficiales muestran que VOSH cerr\u00f3 la denuncia sin inspeccionar el lugar y bas\u00e1ndose en una carta enviada por los abogados de la empresa que dec\u00eda que el problema se hab\u00eda resuelto. Un representante de la compa\u00f1\u00eda dijo que Bevans no ten\u00eda comentarios al respecto.\nCinco d\u00edas despu\u00e9s que VOSH recibiera la denuncia, Virginia se convirti\u00f3 en el primer estado en aprobar un est\u00e1ndar temporal de emergencia en el pa\u00eds, creando el primer requisito obligatorio de seguridad contra el COVID-19 en el lugar de trabajo. El est\u00e1ndar temporal se aprob\u00f3 m\u00e1s tarde de forma permanente.\nEl est\u00e1ndar protege a los trabajadores contra el COVID-19 al requerir que los empleadores aseguren el debido distanciamiento social y provean equipo de seguridad personal si los controles administrativos o de ingenier\u00eda para proteger a los trabajadores no son factibles.\nUna se\u00f1al de distanciamiento social cuelga dentro de la tienda de ventas de la sucursal de Lindy\u00b4s ubicada en Woolford, Maryland.

(Cr\u00e9dito: Carmen Molina Acosta/Universidad de Maryland)\nSin embargo, la norma no contempla una provisi\u00f3n para las viviendas proporcionadas por los empleadores en donde se alojan los trabajadores migrantes. El Departamento de Salud de Virginia solo emiti\u00f3 una gu\u00eda opcional que recomienda mantener las camas a 6 pies de distancia, aislar a los trabajadores que dan positivo por COVID-19 y evitar el hacinamiento.\nEl Departamento de Salud del estado no tiene autoridad para hacer cumplir la gu\u00eda, dijo un portavoz de la agencia.\n***\nEn agosto, el gobernador de Carolina del Norte, Roy Cooper, un dem\u00f3crata, consider\u00f3 aprobar una orden ejecutiva que hubiera garantizado medidas de seguridad en las viviendas para migrantes, en el transporte y en el lugar de trabajo.

    "content": "Lea en espa\u00f1ol\nFISHING CREEK, Maryland \u2014 For thousands of miles and over two days in April, 59 workers from Mexico traveled together on a bus \u2014 despite the pandemic \u2014 to their legal, seasonal jobs as crabmeat pickers and seafood processors in Maryland\u2019s rural islands.\nLindy\u2019s Seafood, the wholesale crab and oyster company in Maryland that hired the workers, paid for their cross-country trip. The company put them to work the day after they arrived without quarantining or waiting for COVID-19 test results. Those safeguards are not required under state or federal law.\nWithin a week, workers were informed that several people had tested positive for the disease.\nMigrant seafood-processing workers, who are legally hired and transported to the U.S. each season through the federal H-2B visa program, face heightened risks of catching COVID-19.\nThey often travel long distances to their jobs, where they live in communal housing. Classified as essential workers, they are permitted to continue working even if they come in contact with someone who has COVID-19.\nThe U.S. Department of Labor, which runs the H-2B program, did not establish COVID-safety rules for the workers\u2019 cross-country bus travel. Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina \u2014 states with flourishing seafood industries that rely on H-2B seafood workers \u2014 also failed to provide H-2B workers with critical protections in the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\nBetween October 2019 and September 2020, more than 12,000 H-2B workers were authorized to work at seafood companies across the U.S., including 2,232 at 41 companies across these states, according to an analysis by the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland.\nA blackboard at Lindy\u2019s Seafood in Maryland displays crab prices. The company relies on temporary workers from Mexico hired through the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s H-2B visa program to help process crabs during high season. The government authorized more than 12,000 H-2B workers nationwide in 2019-20 for jobs at seafood plants. (Photo credit: Carmen Molina Acosta/University of Maryland)\nOf the three states, only Virginia provided statewide totals for COVID-19 cases at seafood facilities \u2013 106 cases in three outbreaks \u2013 and none of the state health agencies disclose outbreak locations.\nThe Howard Center found COVID-19 outbreaks at seafood plants in all three states through interviews with migrant workers, advocacy groups and a church.\nAdditionally, COVID-19 safety issues in the plants rarely show up in complaints to federal and state agencies in charge of enforcing workplace protections.\nSince January 2020, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration received 63,455 workplace complaints related to COVID-19 across the U.S. Of those complaints, 32 were against seafood-processing companies, which have more H-2B workers than any other industry except landscaping, a Howard Center analysis found.\n\u201cIf they complain, they could be fired in retaliation and lose their lawful status in the U.S.,\u201d said Clermont Ripley, an attorney for the nonprofit North Carolina Justice Center. \u201cIt\u2019s this very captive workforce who are going to put up with a good bit of violations of their rights in order to be able to continue working lawfully.\u201d\nIn the absence of government standards and enforcement, decisions on how to keep workers safe from COVID-19 are largely left up to their employers.\nMost \u201creally do care and really want to keep everybody safe,\u201d said Lydia Hock, whose agency, Labormex LLC, has recruited H-2B workers for the seafood industry.\n\u201cIf a worker doesn\u2019t feel safe, they obviously don\u2019t have to come,\u201d she added. \u201cThere\u2019s millions of people in Mexico that want these opportunities.\u201d\n\u00a0\nFederal inaction sets the tone\nEach season, H-2B workers travel from their hometowns in Mexico to one of seven Mexican cities, where a U.S. consulate processes and approves their visas. Then, transportation companies drive workers to different U.S. states.\nWorkers risk contracting COVID-19 at each stage of this process.\nThey may wait days, if not weeks, for their visas to process. Away from home, they often crowd into shared hotel rooms, which can be risky during the pandemic.\nAfter getting their visas approved, workers head to the United States. H-2B employers are required to pay for transportation under federal law, and may use an H-2B recruiter to coordinate the trips.\nH-2B seafood workers told the Howard Center about traveling thousands of miles in a packed bus in September, and sleeping in a crowded van with more than a dozen other workers for two nights in January.\nAfter arriving, workers typically enter group housing provided by their employers \u2014 often at a weekly rate the workers pay. Some start work the next day.\nLindy\u2019s employees stand on a loading dock in April. One day earlier, 59 migrant workers arrived on a bus from Mexico. Despite the long journey during a pandemic, they went to work before being tested for COVID-19 or quarantined. Such safeguards are not required by the federal or state government. (Photo credit: Carmen Molina Acosta/University of Maryland)\nThe U.S. Department of Labor has not issued COVID guidance for migrant workers\u2019 bus travel to the U.S., department spokesperson Edwin Nieves confirmed. And there is no requirement that workers be tested for COVID-19 when they arrive, or while they are in transit.\nThese holes in the regulatory system prompted worker-advocacy organizations \u2014 including the migrant-rights organization Centro de los Derechos del Migrante, the North Carolina Justice Center and the Southern Poverty Law Center \u2014 to send a letter in April 2020 to key federal agencies seeking immediate action to protect migrant workers.\nThe letter recommended that the U.S. secretaries of Labor, State, Health and Human Services, and Homeland Security take steps to prevent unnecessary crowding near U.S. consular offices, to transport workers on half-full buses and to arrange for individual hotel accommodations while traveling. The letter also called for OSHA to inspect H-2B housing in the U.S. for COVID-19 safety, and to have employers provide paid sick leave and coordinate medical care to H-2B workers during the pandemic.\nNone of the recommendations were adopted. A law requiring many employers to provide COVID-19 sick leave to employees, including H-2B workers, expired in December. The Howard Center found that Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina also have not established local protections for H-2B workers that advocates say are needed.\n\u00a0\nOutbreaks ripple across states\nIn September, Santiago \u2014 an H-2B worker who asked the Howard Center to identify him by a pseudonym because he feared losing his job at Bonums Oyster Company in Kinsale, Virginia \u2014 boarded a crowded bus in Monterrey, Mexico, with around 40 other H-2B workers.\nThey traveled a day and a half to get to work. Santiago described taking precautions on the bus, like wearing a mask and using hand sanitizer. He remembered not being able to stay 6 feet away from other workers.\nTwo days after the bus arrived in Virginia, Bonums took the workers for COVID testing at a clinic, Santiago said. His test came back positive, and the company quarantined him in a house with 11 others for 15 days, he said.\nRecords show that state officials were aware of the situation. An October email between staff members at the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry noted that 33 Bonums employees tested positive for COVID-19.\nCalls to Bonums were referred to a representative of the company, who declined to be identified or to comment.\n\n\n\nIn January, Monica \u2014 an H-2B worker, who also asked to be identified by a pseudonym to protect her job \u2014 left Mexico\u2019s Pacific coast for a cool winter on the Atlantic, packing crab and shrimp meat at Fulcher\u2019s Seafood companies in Aurora and Oriental, North Carolina.\nThe nearly 2,500-mile trip began at midnight, when Monica climbed into a van with more than a dozen other workers. They stopped for two days, waiting for visas from the U.S. consulate. Then, they rode straight across the U.S., sleeping two nights inside the van.\nAfter arriving in Aurora, Monica said she moved into migrant housing provided by the company for a weekly fee, and took up her spot on the processing line without being tested for COVID-19.\nThey didn\u2019t do testing, she said in Spanish, \u201cuntil there were already cases.\u201d\nHer first symptoms appeared within three weeks. She lost her sense of smell, her bones ached and she felt like she had the flu. She does not have health insurance nor speak English, so a friend booked her an appointment to get tested at a CVS pharmacy. The results came back positive.\nAfter falling ill, Monica and other workers were quarantined by the company for at least eight days, she said. She received half pay while quarantining and did not seek health care while sick, she said.\nFulcher\u2019s later confirmed nine cases among migrant and local workers between two plants. But when the Howard Center asked local health department directors about the outbreak, they said they had no record of it.\nAside from child-care centers and long-term care facilities, companies are not required to report COVID-19 cases among workers to the state health department or local health departments, a North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said.\nWhen people test positive for COVID-19, they are asked for their employment information but are not required to provide it, said James Madson, director at the health department in Beaufort County, where a Fulcher\u2019s plant is located.\nAccording to Madson, 15% of workers who test positive in Beaufort County do not provide their place of employment.\nMonica said she and the other H-2B seafood workers did not say where they worked while getting tested or after receiving positive results for COVID-19. She said she did not recall being asked.\n***\nIn Maryland, on a tiny chain of islands in the Chesapeake Bay, 50 seafood workers contracted COVID-19 last summer, according to the Dorchester County Health Department. The agency declined to disclose the locations, citing confidentiality laws in Maryland.\nThose testing positive last July included seven H-2B crab pickers at Lindy\u2019s.\nElizabeth Harding, a member of St. Mary Refuge of Sinners \u2014 a church located 40 minutes away \u2014 heard workers had been moved to a company-provided house to quarantine. Harding and another church member drove to Walmart that day and spent around $300 on food that she said the H-2B workers lacked in quarantine.\nThe church also called the Dorchester County Health Department when a Lindy\u2019s worker needed medical assistance for COVID-19, Harding said, and health department staff drove to the islands within hours to check on the infected workers.\nSt. Mary Refuge of Sinners church members Elizabeth Harding (left) and Sonia Cruz (right) stand in front of Minnette Mills Dick Memorial Hall in Cambridge, Maryland. Harding arranged for the Dorchester County Health Department to provide COVID-19 education and testing for migrant seafood workers and others at the hall last year after the 6 p.m. Spanish Mass. (Photo credit: Brittany Nicole Gaddy/University of Maryland)\nAubrey Vincent, vice president of Lindy\u2019s, confirmed that seven workers contracted COVID-19 last year. All infected workers were quarantined in a separate house, she said, and she arranged for workers to be able to order food for delivery.\nShe also said Lindy\u2019s had implemented safety measures in response to the pandemic. Masks are provided to workers, they are distanced 6 feet apart and sanitation procedures have been increased, she said.\nYet, this year, when 59 H-2B workers arrived in Maryland after two days of cross-country travel, Lindy\u2019s put them to work the next day.\nVincent said the decision to put the new arrivals to work before being tested for COVID-19 was based on discussions with state and county health officials.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve already ridden in a bus all the way here,\u201d Vincent said. \u201cThey\u2019re already in the houses. They have already been exposed with each other.\u201d\n\u201cWhy is working the issue, if that\u2019s not where the contamination is happening?\u201c she asked.\nAccording to Vincent, the recruiter in charge of finding H-2B workers for Lindy\u2019s said workers would be tested before crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.\nHowever, two H-2B workers at Lindy\u2019s said no test was given when they crossed the border. A negative COVID-19 test is not required for travel into the U.S. by land, according to the U.S. consulate in Mexico.\nVincent said she arranged for the new Lindy\u2019s H-2B crew to be tested on April 22, two days after their arrival. Company staff informed workers early the next week that several people tested positive, according to knowledgeable sources who did not want to be identified so they could speak frankly.\nWhen first asked about the new cases, Vincent said those testing positive had been placed in a house to quarantine for 10 days and those testing negative received vaccinations.\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to err on the side of caution,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are following the same procedures we did last year.\u201d\nIn a subsequent conversation, she said she did not intend her remarks to be confirmation that workers tested positive.\n\u201cWe are not going to confirm or deny whether people are positive or not,\u201d she said.\nAubrey Vincent, the vice president of Lindy\u2019s Seafood Inc., at the company\u2019s retail location in Woolford, Maryland. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Vincent said workers were distanced six feet apart, masks were provided and sanitation procedures increased. Nonetheless, workers contracted COVID-19. (Photo credit: Carmen Molina Acosta/University of Maryland)\nDorchester County Health Department spokesperson Angela Grove said the agency knew of no new outbreaks \u2014 defined as five or more cases \u2014 at seafood plants but added that workers are not required to list their workplace when tested.\nSo while the county has had 130 new cases since April 20, she said, \u201cI do not know how many of those are employees of seafood manufacturing plants.\u201d Even if she did, Grove said, she was barred by law from disclosing the company names.\n\u00a0\nStates limit protections\nLast July, a coalition of health professionals, including former OSHA officials and migrant-worker advocates, urged Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan to create an emergency temporary standard, which would require Maryland workplaces to take steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\u201cIt should not be left at the discretion of employers, whether they provide personal protective equipment, whether they have somebody at the worksite that knows what to do in case somebody is showing symptoms of COVID,\u201d said Sulma Guzm\u00e1n, policy director and legislative counsel at Centro de los Derechos del Migrante, which pushed for the standard.\nA spokesperson for Hogan told The Baltimore Sun in August that the standard was not needed, because the governor gave local health officials the authority to close down unsafe workplaces.\nAsked by the Howard Center how many workplaces had been closed down, a spokesperson for the Maryland Department of Health wrote that the agency does not maintain a central database of companies cited by local health departments and law enforcement for not complying with COVID-19 orders. Grove said the Dorchester County Health Department had not shut down any seafood facilities.\nA Maryland House bill attempted to expand migrant-worker protections in January. It would have required employers to arrange separate housing for COVID-positive workers and ensure COVID-safety precautions in worksites, migrant housing and transit. It also would have required the Maryland Department of Labor to inspect migrant housing for safe conditions during the pandemic.\nThe bill died in committee in February.\n\n\n\nIn the coastal town of Kinsale, Virginia, Ronald and Shirley Bevans received federal approval last year to hire 110 H-2B baitfish and shellfish packers, 130 H-2B oyster shuckers and 14 seafood processors at their seafood-wholesale businesses: Bevans Oyster Company and Bonums Oyster Company.\nVirginia Occupational Safety and Health (VOSH), the OSHA-designated state agency in Virginia, received a complaint about Bevans last July.\nThe company did not enforce social distancing at work or in migrant housing, the complaint said, and workers who tested positive and lived onsite were not quarantined in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, placing others at risk of contracting and spreading COVID-19.\nState records show VOSH closed the complaint without an inspection, relying on a letter from the company\u2019s lawyers that the problems had been addressed. A representative of the company said Bevans had no comment.\nFive days after VOSH received the Bevans complaint, Virginia became the first state to enact an emergency temporary standard, creating the nation\u2019s first enforceable COVID-safety requirements for the workplace. The standard later became permanent.\nThe standard protects workers from COVID-19 by requiring employers to ensure social distancing and provide personal protective equipment if administrative or engineering controls to protect workers are not feasible.\nA social distancing sign hangs inside of Lindy\u2019s retail location in Woolford, Maryland. The state has not established COVID-19 protections for migrant seafood workers that advocates say are needed. (Photo credit: Carmen Molina Acosta/University of Maryland)\nBut there was no provision for employer-provided migrant housing. Instead, the Virginia Department of Health issued optional guidance to migrant-housing operators to keep beds 6 feet apart, isolate COVID-positive workers and avoid overcrowding.\nThe state\u2019s health department does not have authority to enforce this guidance, a department spokesperson said.\n***\nIn August, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, considered an executive order that would have ensured COVID-safety precautions in migrant housing, transportation and worksites. It would have protected the 907 H-2B visa recipients certified to work in North Carolina seafood plants between January and August 2020.\nBut Cherie Berry, a Republican who led the North Carolina Department of Labor, voiced strong opposition. She wrote to Cooper that the order would overregulate employers and that her agency, which does not report to the governor, could not enforce the regulations.\nCooper decided not to sign the executive order.\nIn September, more than 100 worker-advocacy organizations protested North Carolina\u2019s failure to protect migrant workers through the pandemic. They cited the failed executive order and the state\u2019s refusal to disclose workplace-outbreak data.\nIn October, additional advocacy groups requested that the state Labor Department either adopt an emergency temporary standard or initiate new rules to protect workers from COVID-19.\nBerry rejected both requests.\n\u201cWhile I am not dismissing the tragic deaths that have occurred as a result of this virus, statistically the virus has not been proven likely to cause death or serious physical harm from the perspective of an occupational hazard,\u201d Berry wrote in an email to the advocates.\nThe advocates requested OSHA to investigate the department\u2019s failure to \u201cadequately and lawfully\u201d respond to the advocates\u2019 request for rulemaking, along with its failure to investigate complaints of workplace-safety hazards during the pandemic.\nThe Howard Center could not reach Berry for comment, and Labor spokesperson Jennifer Haigwood said the agency could not comment about an ongoing investigation.\n\u00a0\nThe cycle repeats\nIn March, senators from Maryland and Virginia sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, urgently requesting more H-2B workers before April 1 \u2014 when the new crabbing season would begin in Maryland and Virginia.\n\u201cWithout these additional visas, our states\u2019 treasured seafood industries \u2026 will be forced to scale back operations, default on contracts, lay off full-time American workers or, in some cases, close operations completely,\u201d wrote Maryland Sens. Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen, and Virginia Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, all Democrats.\nIn April, Hogan requested that DHS immediately increase the number of H-2B worker visas to the maximum allowable under federal law.\n\u201cThese essential workers are vital to Maryland\u2019s seafood industry and market, which has grown to include regional, national, and international reach,\u201d Hogan wrote.\nOn April 20 \u2014 the same day the 59 H-2B workers arrived at Lindy\u2019s \u2014 DHS announced it would make an additional 22,000 H-2B visas available this year.\n\u201cThe H-2B program is designed to help U.S. employers fill temporary seasonal jobs,\u201d said DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, \u201cwhile safeguarding the livelihoods of American workers.\u201d\n\u00a0\nVanessa S\u00e1nchez Pulla and Brittany Nicole Gaddy reported from Maryland and Virginia.

    "summary": "Maryland's proposed Trust Act aims to build trust between immigrants and law enforcement by prohibiting inquiries about immigration status and ending cooperation with ICE in sensitive locations, but faces opposition from some counties concerned about public safety. Advocates argue the bill is crucial for community safety as it encourages immigrants to report crimes without fear of deportation.",
    "content": "A bill that would prohibit law enforcement from inquiring about immigration status and end police cooperation with ICE in Maryland drew emotional testimony from immigrants, advocacy groups and lawmakers on Wednesday.\nReferred to as the Trust Act by some, SB0088 and HB0304 would end the federal 287(g) Criminal Alien Program in participating jurisdictions, prevent law enforcement from asking about immigration status and protect immigrants from ICE in sensitive locations, such as schools, courthouses and hospitals. \nThe 287(g) Criminal Alien Program allows ICE to enter into agreements with state and local law enforcement to deputize officers as federal immigration agents. \nThis bill, which would end those agreements in Maryland, is extremely important to build trust between the police and community. Immigrants shouldn\u2019t be afraid to report a crime, said Del. Wanika Fisher, D-Prince George\u2019s, a sponsor of the bill.\n\u201cWhen one community doesn\u2019t feel safe with law enforcement and participating, it affects everyone,\u201d Fisher said. \nThree Maryland jurisdictions participate in the 287(g) program: Cecil, Frederick and Harford counties. \nThese jurisdictions argue that this bill poses a threat to public safety. Asking for someone\u2019s location of birth is a routine part of processing information, Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler, R, said. \n\u201cPart of public safety is identifying who you\u2019re bringing into custody and whether other jurisdictions want them and what kind of criminal history they have,\u201d Gahler said in an interview with Capital News Service. \nThere\u2019s no reason law enforcement officers shouldn\u2019t be allowed to notify ICE if someone is here illegally, Gahler said.\nPeople call it the Trust Act for a reason, said Cathryn Paul, research and policy analyst at CASA, the largest immigrant services and advocacy organization in Maryland. Immigrant families do not trust the police or the government, Paul said. \nThe 287(g) program allows local officers to turn into ICE agents when they have minimal training, almost no oversight or accountability and many aren\u2019t bilingual, Paul said.\n\u201cThe police should not be playing ICE. The police should not be acting as ICE agents in any way,\u201d Paul said.  \nPolicies like this will lower crime rates because it establishes trust and encourages immigrants to report crimes, Paul said. Immigrants have been keeping the country afloat during the pandemic; lawmakers must take action to support them, Paul said.  \nHowever, Richard Jurgena, a retired Navy officer and resident of Darnestown, Maryland, said in his written testimony last year that the Constitution is the law of the land. He pointed to the bill\u2019s fiscal and policy note under \u201cCurrent Law\u201d that begins with \u201cWhile immigration is controlled by federal law,\u201d to prove that immigration cannot be separated from the federal government. \nThe law is the law, those opposed to the bill have said. \nMuch of the testimony, however, argued that undocumented immigrants are anything but criminals. \nMaria Perez was placed in handcuffs in Prince George\u2019s County in May of 2018 after she was stopped for speeding by police and handed over to an immigration agent, treated like she had committed a criminal act, she said. She testified in Spanish, with her written testimony in English on the screen. \nOn March 18, Perez has a court date, which will determine whether she can stay in this country with her children or would be deported back to El Salvador where she fled from 16 years ago. \nA 15-year-old boy, Yovani Isaula, testified that his mother, Nora Argueta, was deported after a Maryland state trooper detained her on the highway when her car broke down on a highway in Baltimore in January of 2019.\nIsaula was confused about what was happening because he thought police officers were there to help, but rather they detained his mother and he had to learn how to take care of himself, he said. \n\u201cWe need to repair the relationship between the community and the police because so many deportations caused by the police have caused us to lose our trust in them,\u201d Perez said.",

    "content": "Using executive orders and new legislative proposals, the Biden administration is attempting a sweeping overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration system \u2013 changes that are aimed at reversing the policies of the Donald Trump years.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are dedicated to achieving and, quite frankly, are working around the clock to replace the cruelty of the past administration with an orderly, humane, and safe immigration process,\u201d Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters at a White House press conference Monday. \u201cIt is hard, and it will take time.\u201d\u00a0\nPresident Joe Biden issued a series of executive orders early last month that required a review of Trump\u2019s actions that created barriers to legal immigration and hindered asylum-seekers, and he set up a task force to reunite families separated at the United States-Mexico border.\u00a0\nOn Jan. 20, his first day in office, Biden also sent Congress a legislative package, called the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which would create an eight-year path to citizenship instead of the original 13 for those living in the United States illegally.\u00a0\nThe proposed legislation\u00a0includes an exemption for undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children who fall under Temporary Protected Status, so-called \u201cdreamers.\u201d Individuals who came to the United States before Jan. 1 would qualify for green cards, thus granting them legal status.\u00a0\nThe measure also would seek to clear EB-5 visa backlogs, remove the word \u201calien\u201d and replace it with \u201cnoncitizen\u201d in immigration laws, and invest $4 billion over four years in the U.S.-Mexico border area and Central American nations of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.\nDemocratic congressional leaders have embraced the Biden plan, but differences in their own party may delay action for some weeks, according to a report by Politico on Thursday.\nIn addition, Biden\u2019s immigration package faces widespread opposition among Republicans. Numerous bipartisan negotiations among lawmakers over recent years to find an immigration compromise have collapsed.\nMayorkas said that the Trump administration had \u201cgutted\u201d the U.S. immigration system.\nHe also noted that the Biden administration did not \u201chave the facilities available or equipped to administer the humanitarian laws that our Congress passed years ago.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt takes time to rebuild an entire system and to process individuals at the border in a safe and just way,\u201d he said.\nAlthough U.S. Customs and Border Protection has reported between 3,000 and 4,000 daily illegal crossings at the southern border, Mayorkas declined to call it a crisis.\n\u201cThis is a challenge that the border communities, the non-governmental organizations, the people who care for individuals seeking humanitarian relief all understand it is an imperative,\u201d the secretary said. \u201dEveryone understands what occurred before us, what we need to do now.\u00a0 And we are getting it done.\u201d\u00a0\nFor many in the Hispanic community, Biden\u2019s recent actions are a welcome first step following the harsh immigration rules put in place by Trump under a \u201czero tolerance\u201d policy.\u00a0\nOne of the most visible and disturbing results of that earlier policy was an estimated 5,500 children separated from their parents at the border. Hundreds remain separated.\u00a0\nDomingo Garcia, the national president of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), believes that the Biden plan is important to open up legal immigration and citizenship to the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country who have not been able to use legal channels.\u00a0\n\u201cWe need to get it done in this year, 2021,\u201d Garcia told Capital News Service. \u201cTime is of the essence with the elections two years away, when immigration can be turned into another political pinata and immigrants are used as a source to divide Americans. It\u2019s important that we get this off the table and move on to recovering from COVID and the economic questions we\u2019ve had.\u201d\nThe task force aimed at reunifying families at the border is led by Mayorkas and will receive input from first lady Dr. Jill Biden.\u00a0\nMore than 600 children have been separated at the border from their parents for more than two years.\u00a0\nGarcia believes the first step in making sure the reunification efforts work is making it clear that parents will not be arrested when picking up their children and that they will not be subject to deportation, which was happening under the Trump administration.\u00a0\n\u201cIf those safeguards are in place, then actually all of those children can be reunited in 90 to 120 days,\u201d he said. \u201cUnfortunately, some of those parents have been deported back to their countries of origin, and that will be difficult, or complex, for unification.\u201d\u00a0\nWhen it comes to reassuring the Latino and Hispanic community that harmful orders against those wanting to emigrate here won\u2019t be repeated, Garcia said, the Biden administration still must deal with\u00a0 \u201cthousands of refugees in squalor in refugee camps under the \u2018Stay in Mexico\u2019 order.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe Trump administration committed horrific human rights abuses by separating families at the border,\u201d Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, said in a statement. He is also head of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.\n\u201cI commend President Biden for immediately working to reunite these families and ensure these atrocities never happen again,\u201d he said.\nCastro and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, are the authors of legislation that would grant lawful permanent resident status to eligible people who were separated by the Department of Homeland Security during the Trump years.\u00a0\nProspects for comprehensive immigration changes remain poor. The partisan divide in Congress on the issue has not narrowed. Most GOP lawmakers have viewed Democratic efforts to reform immigration as too lenient and not focused enough on border security.\n\u201cBiden wasted no time pulling out his pen and unraveling policies critical to our national security, border security, and immigration enforcement,\u201d Rep. John Katko, R-New York, wrote last month on FoxNews.com.\u00a0\nThe ranking Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, Katko wrote: \u201cFrom pausing deportations to halting border wall construction and ending the \u2018Remain in Mexico\u2019 policy, the president slapped an \u2018open\u2019 sign on our border \u2013 during a global pandemic.\u201d\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, tweeted that the Biden plan amounted to \u201ctotal amnesty, no regard for the health or security of Americans, and zero enforcement.\u201d",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 Maryland lawmakers heavily debated a bill concerning ICE detention centers on Wednesday, including testimony from a previous detainee who spoke about her experience in a detention center.\nThe Dignity Not Detention Act would prevent the state\u2019s detention centers from renewing existing contracts with ICE or private prison companies and prevent the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency from coming into Maryland in the future to build new detention centers.\nAdditionally, under this bill, SB0478 and HB0016, if ICE is planning to build any new detention centers in Maryland, the public would be informed.\n\u201cICE detention is horrible, but it is a million times more horrible and devastating during the pandemic,\u201d said Cathryn Paul, research and policy analyst at CASA, the largest immigrant services and advocacy organization in Maryland.\nThere have been multiple accounts of immigrants in Maryland facilities who were detained and not given masks until late into the pandemic and people who weren\u2019t given basic necessities when they got sick, Paul said.\nA vast majority of detainees have no criminal record \u2014 other than the possible immigration violations for which they are being detained \u2014 but even if they did, no one should be subject to unsafe treatment in the United States, said Del. Vaughn Stewart, D-Montgomery, a sponsor of the bill.\nMaryland has three ICE detention centers, one each in Howard County, Frederick County and Worcester County.\nThe three jurisdictions are to receive approximately $7.8 million in total payments, based on per diem rates, from the federal government in fiscal 2021 to house individuals, under detention agreements, according to the bill\u2019s fiscal and policy note.\nOpponents of this bill make a public safety argument.\nThis bill is a backdoor attempt at attacking programs that aim to keep communities safe, Frederick County Sheriff Chuck Jenkins, R, said in an interview with Capital News Service.\nThere are a lot of false narratives about the conditions of these private detention facilities, said Shari Rendall, director of state and local engagement at the Federation for American Immigration Reform. If detention facilities don\u2019t comply with and enforce strict standards, the United States becomes a nation without laws, Rendall said.\n\u201cProponents of Dignity Not Detention want to make our immigration laws meaningless. Congress has entrusted ICE to enforce our immigration laws, which means that ICE has an obligation to remove those illegally in the country,\u201d Rendall said.\nThe intention of this bill could backfire if ICE is required to detain people outside of Maryland because detainees would be taken further from their families and might not have access to counsel, Rendall said.\nSen. Robert Cassilly, R-Harford, indicated during a Senate committee hearing that the bill appears to be more of a political message than a measure to counter unfair treatment of undocumented immigrants.\nNora Argueta testified from El Salvador on Wednesday, speaking through a translator on Zoom. Argueta is a CASA member who was deported after living almost 18 years in the United States.\nArgueta recounted for lawmakers the time she was detained for 10 months in Worcester County while she was fighting her case. None of the guards spoke Spanish, she said, even though most of the people in the detention center were Hispanic.\nHer time in detention was \u201ctraumatic\u201d and she told a story of when she grabbed onto a guard to ask for help, but they took it as an act of aggression, stripped her and held her on the ground, she said.\nProponents say this bill is connected to the broader effort of working on racial justice in Maryland and across the country.\n\u201cLegislators are finally rising up to answer the calls of the Black Lives Matter movement and take action on criminal justice reform. Dignity Not Detention is just one piece of addressing our bigger movement to end mass incarceration in Maryland,\u201d Paul said.\nA hearing is scheduled in a House of Delegates committee on March 3. If passed, this bill would go into effect July 1, 2021.",

Her life, and those of many others without permanent legal status, remains in limbo as they hope for substantial policy changes under the new administration.",
    "content": "Yoslin Amaya Hernandez, a Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipient, is hesitant to celebrate President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory just yet. She says she is uncertain whether he will live up to the promises he\u2019s made on immigration policy.\nBiden campaigned to reverse policies enacted under President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. Now, with only a little over a month to the inauguration, Amaya Hernandez and many of the nearly 1 million immigrants like her in Maryland, along with supporters and critics, await the new administration to see whether substantial policy changes will be delivered.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a very vulnerable community,\u201d Amaya Hernandez, 23, of Montgomery County, Maryland, said. \u201cIf he is promising things for the community and these things don\u2019t happen\u2026we\u2019re back to the uncertainty.\u201d\nWhen Amaya Hernandez was eight years old, she and her mother and younger sister left El Salvador and crossed the Mexican border to enter the United States. They were caught and an immigration case was opened. In 2007, a judge ordered a voluntary departure, but the family stayed, so they were ordered deported.\nDACA allowed Amaya Hernandez and thousands of other undocumented youths to remain in the country and work for temporary renewal periods.\nDue to the program, Amaya Hernandez has been able to enroll at the University of Maryland \u2014 where she is currently a senior majoring in government and politics \u2014 and take on several jobs, often at once, to provide for her two kids, ages 3 and 5.\nWhile she is applying for permanent residency because her husband is a U.S. citizen, she fears being deported before obtaining legal status and potentially being prohibited from re-entering the country for 10 years.\n\u201cAt any given moment, I could be gone,\u201d she said. \u201cMy kids have to stay here and they have to be without their mother for who knows how long.\u201d\nHer life and those of many people in Maryland without permanent legal status remains in limbo.\nMaryland has about 275,000 undocumented immigrants, who as of 2018 made up nearly 30% of the state\u2019s large immigrant population, according to the American Immigration Council.\nUndocumented immigration has been strictly scrutinized by the Trump administration, which included terminating DACA on Sept. 5, 2017 \u2014 the very day Amaya Hernandez\u2019s sister turned 15 and would have been eligible to apply but could no longer do so.\nWhile Biden has promised to reinstate DACA, a Dec. 4 court ruling ordered the Department of Homeland Security to begin accepting new DACA applications and restore the two-year renewal period that the current administration shortened to just one year.\nBiden, meanwhile, also has committed to revising \u201ctemporary protected status\u201d (TPS) designations, which prevents people from being returned to certain countries deemed unsafe.\nOn Sept. 14, the Trump administration terminated TPS designations. Recently, they were extended for some citizens of El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, Sudan, Honduras and Nepal until at least October 2021.\nBiden has also committed to revamping deportation, detention and enforcement policies. Proposed changes include creation of a task force to find parents of 545 migrant children who were separated at the border, a 100-day freeze on deportations and the reversal of the Migrant Protection Protocols, under which families with children are sent to Mexico to await their U.S. asylum cases.\n\u201cThe Biden transition team has already kind of signaled that they want to immediately roll back many of the stringent asylum policies that the Trump administration put in through executive order,\u201d said Mike Amezcua, assistant professor of history at Georgetown University.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of a lot of promises being made right now. And hopefully, Biden will deliver on many of them,\u201d he added.\nJessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center of Immigration Studies, a think tank that advocates lower immigration rates, believes rolling back asylum and deportation policies will lead to conflict within the Biden administration and a potential border crisis.\n\u201cThe president-elect has made no secret of his interest in enacting a massive amnesty for almost everyone who\u2019s now in the country illegally,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe perception around the world is that Biden is going to loosen the rules so they might as well start coming down.\u201d\nBiden has also made promises to legal immigrants, which includes increasing the overall number of temporary, work-based visas \u2014 a move that would impact immigrants from, among other places, India, China and the Philippines, who make up a large portion of Maryland\u2019s immigrants.\nIn June, the Trump administration halted the issuance of work-based visas and green cards until the end of the year.\nAccording to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), citizens from India receive almost 75% of H1-B visas despite being just 6% of the state\u2019s immigrants, according to data from the American Immigration Council. The visa is issued to highly-skilled workers in \u201cspeciality occupations,\u201d such as those in the tech industry, and is the most popular of 22 work-based visas.\nChinese workers \u2014 5% of the state\u2019s immigrants \u2014 receive nearly 12% of H1-B visa, while Filipinos \u2013 4% of Maryland immigrants \u2013 get under 1%.\n\u201cWe need to bring in the talent, we should have the ability to bring the talent, not to replace Americans but to supplement us or to give us the brain power that is needed to stay ahead of countries like China and others coming faster and harder,\u201d said Sanjay Puri, chairman at the U.S. India Political Action Committee, a bipartisan organization representing Indian-Americans.\nBiden has promised to repeal Trump\u2019s travel ban \u2014 one of Trump\u2019s first controversial immigration moves in 2017 that was extended early this year. The ban particularly affects Nigerian immigrants in Maryland, the state\u2019s fourth-largest immigrant group.\nThe travel ban barred visas to citizens of predominantly-Muslim and African countries, including Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, Venezuela and North Korea. Residents of Nigeria, Myanmar, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Sudan and Tanzania were only allowed visitor visas to prevent them from settling permanently in the United States.\nIn a symbolic signal of planned policy shifts, Biden nominated Alejandro Mayorkas as head of the Department of Homeland Security. If confirmed, Mayorkas would be the first immigrant to lead the agency.\nYet Georgetown\u2019s Amezcua is unsure if this pick sends the best message to immigrants.\n\u201cIn the appointment of Mayorkas, there is really a feeling that Biden and the Biden team right now is not really meeting the moment when they appoint somebody with what I would argue is kind of like a tarnished record,\u201d he said.\nMayorkas served as deputy secretary of homeland security and director of USCIS under President Barack Obama, who enacted the DACA program but was also dubbed \u201cdeporter-in-chief\u201d by critics because removals increased significantly in comparison to previous administrations (although apprehensions and overall deportations decreased).\nBut Puri views Mayorkas\u2019s background and experience as positives.\n\u201cDHS is a huge, huge part of our government, a huge bureaucracy. We need somebody who\u2019s got really hands-on experience,\u201d he said.\nPuri also sees immigration reform as crucial, even if it remains a controversial and complex issue.\n\u201cIf we can have a comprehensive reform, it\u2019s really going to be good for the country,\u201d Puri said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be healing, bringing out the people who are in the shadows, because everybody knows they are here and a key part of our country.\u201d",

    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that prevents some residents brought to the United States as children from being deported, is being restored to its former, Obama-era policies after a ruling on Dec. 4 that overturned the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to limit and eventually end the program.\nDACA is a program started in 2012 by the Obama administration to protect those who came to the United States before age 16 from being deported.\nWhen granted DACA status, recipients are given a two-year work permit that they continually renew.\nTo be eligible for DACA, someone must be born after June 15, 1981, have come to the United States before turning 16, physically present in the country on June 15, 2012 and when applying for DACA, no lawful status on June 15, 2012, lived in the United States from June 15, 2007, until the present, meet a certain educational requirement and have not been convicted of certain crimes.\nU.S. District Court Judge Nicholas Garaufis ordered the Department of Homeland Security to post an announcement to accept first-time applicants again and for two-year work permits.\nThe Maryland Dream Act allows for DACA students who receive a high school diploma or GED in the state to pay in-state tuition to Maryland universities.\nIn September 2017, the Trump administration stopped new applicants from applying to DACA, only allowing renewals.\nThe United States Citizenship and Immigration Services also announced they will be reinstating applications for an international travel permit called advance parole, which allows DACA recipients to leave the country and still return to the United States.\nAmy Rivera, President of University of Maryland\u2019s Political Latinxs United for Movement and Action in Society, said PLUMAS has a dream fund for DACA recipients to help pay for legal fees.\nPLUMAS works alongside the Undocumented Student Program at the University of Maryland, attends protests and puts on a dream gala every year to raise money.\nA portion of members in PLUMAS are DACA recipients and Rivera said the rulings come as a big relief for a lot of students.\nRivera said it is important to keep a critical eye on the incoming administration\u2019s actions to help DACA students as there is much more to be done, such as taking away renewal fees and creating a gateway to citizenship for recipients.\n\u201cI know a lot of members were definitely worried about it (The Trump Administration\u2019s agenda) because when you are undocumented in the U.S., you are always in a type of limbo,\u201d said Rivera. \u201cYou never know when the authorities in this country are going to decide whether you can stay in this place that you call your home or if you have to be forced back to a land you don\u2019t know much.\u201d\nAs of March, Maryland has 7,870 active DACA recipients. However, 38% of immigrants eligible for DACA had applied as of 2019 in Maryland, according to the American Immigration Council.\n\u201cIt is a wonderful ruling because there are a lot of kids in Maryland and in other states that have been in limbo and have been without protection because of what Trump did with the deferred action program,\u201d said Maryland Delegate Joseline Pena-Melnyk, D-Prince George\u2019s and Anne Arundel. \u201cSo this at least gives them some hope. And it\u2019s wonderful because a lot of them need to work. These are very tough times that we\u2019re living, really unprecedented times with COVID.\u201d\nImmigration attorney Paola Vibriesca, a partner at Ninan + Vibriesca Law in Greenbelt, Maryland, has been in the process of calling back clients, who previously came to her office meeting every requirement except for the fact that they would be first-time applicants, with the good news that they can start the application process immediately.\n\u201cHopefully it\u2019s the beginning,\u201d Vibriesca said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re hoping, when Biden comes into office, is something more permanent or people who know they will be able to stay here with permanent status, not just something that they have to renew every year.\u201d\nPena-Melnyk said DACA recipients working in Maryland are given an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number linked to the IRS to pay taxes, and contributed over $139 million in taxes last year to the state.\nThose without valid U.S. Citizenship and Immigration documentation in Maryland are eligible for a \u201cfederally non-compliant\u201d driver\u2019s license or identification card.\nPena-Melnyk said that Maryland is especially humane and inclusive compared to other states and has a lot of hope for Biden\u2019s presidency to do the same.\nThe incoming administration said they will end Trump\u2019s \u201cdetrimental\u201d asylum policies, reverse policies that separate parents and their children at the border and increase humanitarian resources at the border in the new president\u2019s first 100 days.",

    "summary": "The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has revised the naturalization test, making it longer and more challenging, which experts argue may exacerbate existing backlogs and deter legal immigration.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 The path to citizenship now may be harder as the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services implemented revisions to its naturalization test that went into effect Tuesday.\nIn one of the final moves culminating four years of controversial immigration policies under Donald Trump\u2019s administration, the government is giving a new test that is lengthier, includes topics not covered previously and requires new applicants to correctly answer twice as many questions as the previous test.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an awful, unfair, last-second change in a very sacred process,\u201d said Eric Cohen, executive director of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, an organization that advocates for rights for immigrants and racial justice.\n\u201cThis administration has, for the last nearly four years, tried everything in its power to keep immigrants from coming here legally,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cOnce again (it) is trying to throw sand in the gears of any and all immigration processes\u2026making it harder for people to realize their dream of becoming naturalized citizens.\u201d\nAlthough the passing benchmark for the citizenship test remains 60 percent, applicants will now have to answer 12 out of 20 questions correctly, compared to the previous requirement of 6 out of 10. However, applicants 65 years or older who have lived in the country with \u201clawful permanent resident status\u201d for at least 20 years will be allowed to take the older version of the test, according to the USCIS.\nThe pool from which the set of questions will be chosen has also been expanded \u2014 from 100 to 128 \u2014 which means applicants will have to study more material.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a haphazard attempt to change the test for no reason at all,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThey claimed every 10 years it\u2019s supposed to be changed, which is not true at all. There\u2019s nothing like that in the regulations or in the laws. It\u2019s all made up and lies, so it\u2019s very frustrating then that they do this on their way out the door.\u201d\nUSCIS declined Capital News Service\u2019s request for a comment. But the agency said in its announcement that the revisions were made \u201cas part of a decennial update to ensure that it remains an instrument that comprehensively assesses applicants\u2019 knowledge of American history, government and civic values.\u201d\nThe test is also more difficult in terms of language, Cohen and Nancy Newton, the program director of the citizen preparation program at Maryland\u2019s Montgomery College, told CNS.\nThe new test has shifted from a high-beginning and low-intermediate level of English to a low-intermediate and high-intermediate level, and \u201cit will certainly require highering of skills\u201d of language learners who are applying, according to Newton.\nHowever, Newton said the feedback she received from her students who were a part of the pilot program in which the USCIS tested this revised test was that \u201cgenerally they understood even if they didn\u2019t have the answers.\u201d\nNewton and her team are currently working \u201cto change our curriculum and change our lesson plans to meet with the new content\u201d of the test, which will be in place when new classes start in mid-January, she said.\nMontgomery College is one of only two citizenship preparation courses in the Maryland, Washington and northern Virginia region. The other course is offered at Baltimore City Community College.\nThe revised test does not include any questions regarding geography \u2014 there were previously about 18 questions. Newton said \u201cabout a quarter of the new questions are topics that we may have brushed upon but\u2026not have gone in depth\u201d as they weren\u2019t on the old test, such as the Electoral College and the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.\nIn addition to the new content, some questions have an ideological slant that is concerning, said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy counsel at the American Immigration Council, a nonprofit and nonpartisan immigration advocacy group.\nReichlin-Melnick said he has \u201cserious objection\u201d to questions such as \u201cWho does a U.S. Senator represent?\u201d and \u201cWho does a member of the House of Representatives represent?\u201d The answers, according to the USCIS study guide, are citizens from their state or district, respectively.\n\u201cThis is not true,\u201d Reichlin-Melnick said. \u201cMembers of Congress represent everyone who lives in their district and\u2026this country has always relied on the principle that you don\u2019t have to be a citizen in order to be represented.\u201d\n\u201cHowever, the Trump administration has repeatedly pushed back against this basic idea of what it means to be represented,\u201d he said.\nAnother question that displays \u201csort of a subtle bias towards a more conservative viewpoint\u201d according to Reichlin-Melnick, is \u201cWhat is the purpose of the 10th Amendment?\u201d This is the only question about a constitutional amendment that does not have to do with voting rights or does not include an amendment as one of several possible answers, such as \u201cthe President can serve only two terms. Why?\u201d\nNot asking about other amendments and \u201cchoosing only that one specific amendment raises eyebrows,\u201d Reichlin-Melnick said. \u201cThe amendment is about states\u2019 rights and that is a thing where conservative legal commentators believe the 10th Amendment is particularly important to this country.\u201d\nIn addition to the added questions, increased difficulty and questionable content, one of the effects of these revisions could be worsened processing backlogs, which have already been impacted by the pandemic, experts told CNS.\nSince the questions being asked have doubled from 10 to 20, the interview process could take more time, which may mean that \u201cthey\u2019re going to be able to interview fewer people every day,\u201d Cohen said. That could lead to \u201clong and longer delays for people trying to become a U.S. citizen,\u201d Reichlin-Melnick said.\nThe current processing time for naturalization applications is 10 to 13 months in Baltimore and 11 to 15-and-a-half months in Washington, according to USCIS\u2019s website.\nDue to the backlog and long processing times, the new administration of President Joe Biden could reverse Trump\u2019s move before any applicant actually takes the test. But whether such a reversal will happen is unclear, Cohen said.\nChanging back to the old version of the test \u201cis what (ILRC is) going to ask them to do,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cWe certainly hope (they do) because that would be the right thing to do.\u201d\nReichlin-Melnick held similar expectations from the incoming administration.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with changing questions but it\u2019s a matter of making the test more difficult and longer for no apparent reason, and I certainly would hope that a new administration would take a close look at reversing some of the changes that were made,\u201d he said.\nThe revised test could deter some people. So might a nearly doubled application fee \u2014 from $640 to $1,170 \u2014 if it ever went into effect. The higher fee was set to take effect Oct. 19 but has been blocked by a federal district court in California.\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably going to be some discouragement,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cBut you\u2019re talking about a really resilient group of people, immigrants who have gone through a lot worse than having a more difficult test.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 With the aid of lawmakers, seafood businesses in Maryland, Virginia, Alaska and North Carolina last month won federal approval of an additional 35,000 visas for non-immigrant workers, but the timing couldn\u2019t have been worse.\nWithin days, the coronavirus pandemic began shutting down businesses, including restaurants and retail outlets the seafood industry supplies.\nSome seafood operations let employees go, while others have hired fewer people than they would in a more typical season.\nJohn Martin, owner of the Martin Fish Co. in Ocean City, Maryland, told Capital News Service that a large percentage of the firm\u2019s business is in the retail sector, including market and restaurant sales. Due to the virus, Martin Fish has been unable to open its retail store.\u00a0\n\u201cWe are now in the process of figuring out how to open with the safety of our workers and our customers in mind,\u201d Martin said. \u201cCurrently, we have had to lay off a significant number of employees that are directly relating to those end-user groups.\u201d\nHe added that this has been a lesson for his company: within weeks a global issue can affect the world food markets and he needs to be more prepared for that in the future.\u00a0\nJack Brooks, president of J.M. Clayton Seafood Co. in\u00a0Cambridge, Maryland, explained that the seafood industry is a seasonal business and the coronavirus has hit the hardest during the industry\u2019s\u00a0 prime time.\n\u201cWe were planning on hiring between 65 to 70 workers for the season, but now that the markets have gone down we hired about 25 people,\u201d Brooks said in an interview with CNS. \u201cWe sell our seafood to restaurants and with the restaurants being closed that has really hurt our business. We are taking this pandemic really seriously and are hoping that by next year we will be able to recover from the hard hits we have taken.\u201d\nThe $2 trillion coronavirus aid package passed by Congress and signed into law by President Donald Trump last month includes $300 million for the nation\u2019s fisheries industry.\nThe Maryland congressional delegation sent a letter on April 13 to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Chris Owen, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, requesting that the aid include companies that process fish products for restaurants and grocery stores.\nFishing and processing seafood is a more than $600 million industry in Maryland.\n\u201cA new economic analysis found that Maryland\u2019s oyster aquaculture operations contribute an average of $9 million per year to the state economy and have grown by nearly 25 percent annually since 2012,\u201d the lawmakers wrote. \u201cHowever, that growth, as well as the mostly small and family-owned businesses that comprise Maryland\u2019s seafood industry, is threatened due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nWhenever the seafood industry can go back to relatively normal operations, company officials say the long-term labor problems will remain, despite the visa relief given just before the pandemic struck.\nForeign seasonal workers come to work for the seafood industry each year with the help of the H-2B visas. Such workers are high in demand as these companies would not survive without them.\nA study conducted by Maryland\u2019s Best Seafood found that without the additional H-2B visas released each year, seafood processors would lose close to $49 million in sales. Maryland would lose 914 to 1,367 jobs and the overall hit to the state\u2019s economy could reach $150 million.\u00a0\nA letter to the Department of Homeland Security signed by seven senators, including Maryland Democrats Chris Van Hollen and Ben Cardin, called the visas a \u201ccritical matter.\u201d\n\u201cLocal seafood businesses earn their livelihoods based on perishable products and need H-2B workers to harvest and process their respective seafood products so they can sell those products,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cIf these local businesses lose a customer base one year, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to come back into the industry.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cThe DHS grants a maximum of 66,000 visas to foreign nationals each year through the H-2B visa program, which is operated like a lottery,\u201d the lawmakers said. \u201cThe workers are spread half-and-half to assist non-agricultural companies across the country between the first and second periods of the year.\u201d\nIf companies don\u2019t win workers through the lottery, they could be forced to stop business operations unless the DHS grants more visas for seasonal workers to shuck oysters,\u00a0 process crabs and harvest salmon.\u00a0\nMaryland Delegate Chris Adams, R-Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot & Wicomico, said last month he still had concerns over the recurring shortages of seasonal workers in the industry, which he called \u201cgut-wrenching.\u201d\u00a0\nVan Hollen responded to Adams\u2019s concerns, saying he realized \u201cit\u2019s hard when it seems like we\u2019re doing this on a short-term basis rather than having a long-term solution.\u201d\nVan Hollen, Cardin and Rep. Andy Harris, R-Cockeysville, said they are working together to find this permanent fix.",

    "content": "ANNAPOLIS, Maryland\u2014As Maryland counties and universities face increasing pressure to end their partnerships with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Cecil County\u2019s is recently \u201coperational,\u201d according to an ICE spokeswoman. \nCecil is one of three Maryland counties \u2014 with Frederick and Harford \u2014 that currently have what are known as 287(g) agreements with the federal agency. Through these agreements, ICE trains and authorizes police officers at local detention centers to screen inmates for breaking immigration laws.\nTwo Cecil County officers completed a four-week training in September, ICE spokeswoman Kate Pote said.\nThough the 287(g) training programs do not come with federal funds, other programs with the immigration agency \u2014 to house inmates, and train ICE employees \u2014 have brought in millions in revenue to a few Maryland localities and universities. \nThree counties \u2014 Frederick, Howard and Worcester \u2014 have Intergovernmental Service Agreements with ICE, through which they rent out jail space for immigrant detention. While activists across the state are seeking to end these agreements, officials say the revenue is worth it.\n\u201cI do empathize with the concerns of people, but if what you\u2019re trying to change is how the president decides policy, and you think this is gonna have some impact on that, I just don\u2019t see it,\u201d said Jack Kavanagh, who runs the Howard County Department of Corrections. \u201cYou haven\u2019t changed the policy just because you\u2019ve ended the contract in Howard County \u2026 That\u2019s money for police, schools, where\u2019s that gonna come from?\u201d\n\u00a0Through the 287(g) program, ICE trains and authorizes local officers to enforce immigration laws. Through Intergovernmental Service Agreements, ICE rents space in local detention centers. Five Maryland jurisdictions currently have one or both contracts with ICE, and two Maryland universities have consulting and training contracts. (Ian Round/Capital News Service)\nTim Rothermel, who lives in Elkton, in Cecil County, and works in pharmaceutical sales, has protested ICE across Maryland, and he wants the county to end this contract. Rothermel said these agreements are easily misused and create fear in the immigrant community. \n\u201cWe\u2019re creating more work for our officers, we\u2019re exposing ourselves for liability and lawsuits, just to do something ICE already has the ability to do anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cCreating fear for no reason is costing tax dollars and making us less safe.\u201d\nICE pays for 287(g) training, but after that, this immigration work becomes part of the officers\u2019 jobs. Rothermel argues it takes away from time they could be spending on more important police work. \nRothermel marched against ICE with the activist group Jews United for Justice at the Artscape festival in Baltimore in July. And with a few hundred allies, he obstructed the Howard County detention center in August in protest of that county\u2019s detention agreement.\nOn Aug. 15, Rothermel sent an inquiry to the office of Cecil County Executive Alan McCarthy in which he asked why the county had signed the contract. Sheriff Scott Adams, who signed the contract for the county in February, replied in a letter provided by Rothermel to Capital News Service.\n\u201cThe reason I decided to enter into this program is simple,\u201d Adams wrote. \u201cThe 287g program is not about hunting down illegal residence (sic) who may be living in our county but it is about removing illegal persons from our county who have committed crimes here.\u201d \nA few major highways run through Cecil County. While its immigrant population is small, Adams wrote that drug traffickers, many of them immigrants, often stop there while driving between cities.\n\u201cWe have noticed recent trends where those bad actors are setting up shop in our county and starting drug organizations because it is safer here for them than in other areas,\u201d Adams, a Republican, stated.\n(Adams\u2019s and McCarthy\u2019s offices did not return multiple phone calls from Capital News Service.)\nHoward County has brought in nearly $20 million through its Intergovernmental Service Agreement since it was signed in 2013, Kavanagh said, and Frederick County makes about $1.3 million per year, according to Sheriff Chuck Jenkins. \n\u201cAll that money is turned over to the county coffers,\u201d Jenkins said.\nICE pays Worcester County $87.11 per inmate, per day, according to a contract amendment.\nRothermel said his problem is that those suspected of immigration violations can be turned over to ICE after being arrested and charged with a crime, but before facing a trial.\nRothermel said when he found out about the Cecil contract, he reached out to various progressive groups in search of \u201csympathetic ears.\u201d \nDanielle Contreras, the president of the Cecil County chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens, said she worries officers will use their immigration enforcement authority outside of the detention center. She noted the example of a Salvadoran woman who won a lawsuit against Frederick County after officers profiled and wrongfully arrested her in 2008.\nIn an email, Pote noted the \u201cstringent internal controls and protocols\u201d on officers\u2019 conduct, and said that officers trained under 287(g) were not the ones accused. Pote added that \u201c287(g) trained officers are only authorized to utilize their authority at the detention center.\u201d\n\u201cIf they\u2019re using it in jail, that\u2019s fine,\u201d Contreras said. If not, \u201cThat\u2019s gonna be an issue.\u201d \nThat said, opponents are only in the awareness-raising stage. Rothermel is \u201cnot ready to link arms and lay down on Route 40 or anything like that,\u201d he said.\nImmigrants\u2019 rights advocates have demanded Maryland governments and institutions end their contracts with ICE in recent years, with varying levels of success.\nFrederick County began in November an independent audit of the sheriff\u2019s office\u2019s spending through the 287(g) agreement, according to Jenkins. The audit is expected to take a few months.\nSergio Espa\u00f1a, of the ACLU of Maryland, said he was glad for the audit, but he wants more accountability.\n\u201cWe think that barely scratches the surface,\u201d he said. The 287(g) program is \u201cdenying Maryland residents due process and breaking up families and breaking up public trust.\u201d \nJohns Hopkins University announced in September that it would not renew a contract with ICE, under which it provided emergency medical training. Students at the university, which according to USAspending.gov has earned more than $7 million through its contracts with ICE since 2008, protested and engaged in sit-ins in April against the contracts, and the creation of an independent university police force.\nKim Hoppe, a spokeswoman, said faculty leaders at the Department of Emergency Medicine were the ones who decided to end the contract. She said the university is \u201cworking with the Department of Homeland Security to determine an appropriate transition period for this work, which we anticipate will be completed by spring 2020.\u201d\n\u201cThese contracts were no longer tenable in the general atmosphere,\u201d said Conor Bean, a graduate student in political science who organized with the Hopkins Coalition Against ICE.\nThe University of Maryland has one active contract with ICE, through which it has provided terrorism-related trainings since 2017. ICE has paid $250,000 of the $625,000 contract, which is set to expire in 2022, according to USAspending.gov. The university has not said it will end the contract, despite demands from student activists. The contract is with the ICE division of Homeland Security Investigations, not Enforcement and Removal Operations, the office responsible for detention, arrests and removal.\nThrough the agreement, the university\u2019s National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism provides research \u201con the human causes and consequences of terrorism,\u201d according to the university\u2019s Undocumented Student Program, which cited the university\u2019s Office of Strategic Communications. The office stated the university\u2019s police department does not ask about citizenship, and that the goal of the contract is to provide \u201cscience-based, non-partisan, non-politicized understandings about human behaviors.\u201d\nLast December, Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman ended the county\u2019s 287(g) agreement, arguing it stretched staff too thin and hurt police outreach efforts in Latino communities, according to a December 2018 report. But he kept the detention agreement in place, saying the county\u2019s facility could treat detainees more humanely than others. He vowed to use the revenue from ICE for immigrant legal defense. But in January, ICE ended the detention agreement.\nThe county had the detention agreement in place between 2017 and early 2019, and according to that report took in $118 per inmate per day and more than $4 million in the first 13 months of the agreement. \nKavanagh also said his facilities provided better conditions for detainees than those at the southern border. He said revenue from the agreement has offset the detention center\u2019s costs, and that protesters\u2019 anger is misplaced.\n\u201cI understand the activist point of view, but you have the wrong battlefield,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re upset about the policy of a president and the conditions of some of the facilities on the border.\u201d\nIn deciding to enter the agreement to house ICE detainees, \u201cWe said look: Our mission is public safety, so if you give us criminally involved individuals, that is within our mission.\u201d\nKavanagh said his facility houses convicted felons, criminal gang members, those who have reentered the United States after being deported, and those charged but not yet convicted of jailable offenses. \nHe said ICE pays Howard County $110 per inmate per day. The average stay is about 90 days, he said, and the facility has 95 beds, of which around 65 were full Dec. 3. All detainees are men, he said.\nMolly Amster, the Baltimore director of Jews United for Justice, said the revenue isn\u2019t worth it. She said she thinks the political headwinds are in the activists\u2019 favor in the majority-Democratic Howard County. \n\u201cWhere you have Democratic leadership, you have less collaboration and that\u2019s part of what\u2019s so shocking about Howard County,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat immigrant rights advocates across the country are saying is if you have more beds, they detain more people.\u201d",

The state government is supporting these efforts with a $5 million campaign targeting \"hard-to-reach\" communities.",
    "content": "LANGLEY PARK, Maryland\u2014Two men smoked cigarettes and talked outside an apartment building in Langley Park, an area where almost everyone is from Central America. Three women wearing CASA de Maryland gear approached them, but the men did not appear interested in speaking. One didn\u2019t speak at all, and the other gave one-word answers and looked around as they spoke, not giving them his complete attention.\nThose women, led by Mar\u00eda Gutierrez, CASA\u2019s field director for three states, were canvassing the neighborhood on a recent Saturday to convince residents to fill out the 2020 census.\nGutierrez, speaking in Spanish, asked one of the men his name and whether he knew what the census was. With her red shirt, she identified herself as a member of CASA, the prominent immigrant advocacy organization, which enjoys the trust of Maryland\u2019s immigrant community. (CASA\u2019s headquarters, in an old mansion, is visible from this apartment building.) \nShe told him why the census\u2014the survey of every resident of the United States, conducted every decade\u2014is important: An accurate count will bring more political power, money and resources here, meaning better roads, schools and services. If this area is undercounted, that money will go elsewhere.\nFurthermore, she said, the census gives the community a voice.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an obligation to know about the census,\u201d Gutierrez, who is from Puerto Rico, told the man. \u201cIt\u2019s important to be counted so we can be respected.\u201d\nAfter testing various messaging strategies over the summer, CASA organizers have begun their census education campaign in Maryland\u2019s immigrant communities. \nCASA\u2019s efforts are part of a wider effort in Maryland, where the state government is spending $5 million to encourage \u201chard-to-reach\u201d communities to participate in the survey. \nThe Trump Administration sought to include a question about citizenship on the census, but the Supreme Court struck down that question in June after months of legal challenges. \nResearchers at Harvard\u2019s Shorenstein Center published a study in April that estimated more than 6 million Hispanics would not be counted if the question was included, or more than 12% of the Hispanic population. \nAn undercount of this population would result in $1,800 per person, per year that the area would not receive from the federal government, according to multiple sources. Furthermore, it could tilt political representation and federal funding toward areas with fewer immigrants. \nEven though the 2020 census will not include that question, advocates say, the controversy was enough to scare people.\n\u201cPeople are definitely moved by the resource argument,\u201d said Elizabeth Alex, CASA\u2019s director of organizing. The other most effective message, she said, was \u201cthis idea of being heard, the idea of voice and representing my community and not being erased.\u201d\nGutierrez told Capital News Service that many immigrants, regardless of their legal status, are afraid of interacting with the government, or assume they\u2019re not supposed to fill out the census. She said President Donald Trump\u2019s strict immigration policies have created an unprecedented atmosphere of anxiety and fear in these communities. \n\u201cYour census forms aren\u2019t shared with immigration, they\u2019re not shared with anybody,\u201d Gutierrez told the man, who asked not to be identified.\nAs they spoke, the man became more engaged in the conversation. He asked questions, took her brochure, signed up for more information on her tablet, and told her he would fill out the census.\nIt\u2019s important to tell people how they can benefit from participating, said Julius Valentine Maina, who works in Baltimore for a regional office of the Census Bureau.\n\u201cWe know the threats, but you can also pivot it into an interesting argument,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more accurately you fill it out, the better services you\u2019re gonna get.\u201d\nEric Seymour, a client services manager at the Esperanza Center in Baltimore, said many immigrants refuse to report crimes to the police, even when they\u2019ve been a victim.\n\u201cAlmost any time a person puts their name on a piece of paper, they\u2019re concerned about who\u2019s gonna get their hands on it,\u201d he said. \u201cGuarantees from the government only go so far with certain people.\u201d\nThis will be the first time the census will be conducted mostly online, which will make it much more convenient for many people. But organizations such as CASA will have to work to educate those with limited digital literacy.\nAbout a quarter of the $5 million the state is spending on the effort will go to organizations and government agencies in Baltimore, where there is a higher concentration of hard-to-count communities, according to David Buck, a spokesman for the Maryland Department of Planning. These efforts will primarily target people with low incomes, among them the elderly, families with children younger than 5, immigrants, returning citizens, young black men and homeless people. CASA de Maryland received just under $450,000.\nCatalina Rodriguez Lima, the director of the Baltimore Mayor\u2019s Office of Immigrant Affairs, is coordinating the city\u2019s efforts to reach immigrants and those with limited English proficiency. Before the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case of the citizenship question, Rodriguez Lima told Capital News Service the question would make their work much harder.\n\u201cWe cannot combat people\u2019s justifiable fears,\u201d Rodriguez Lima said.\nShe hopes to assuage them with accurate information. She intends to highlight confidentiality laws, and emphasized Census employees who share data could face fines and/or jail time.\nRodriguez Lima said she\u2019s leaning on her \u201ctentacles in the community\u201d \u2014 trusted advocacy groups, ethnic media, churches, etc. \u2014 because government representatives don\u2019t have the same credibility.\n\u201cThe most trusted sources are those nonprofits that are on the ground on a day-to-day basis,\u201d she said.\nAccording to Alex, this is the first many immigrants are hearing about the census. She doesn\u2019t want them to be taken by surprise when the survey comes in the mail.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want the whole first round of those to just get recycled,\u201d she said.\nAfter the conversation outside the apartment building, Gutierrez walked inside and knocked on every door, leaving brochures at the homes where no one answered. \nOne man cracked his door open, and Gutierrez convinced him to participate, too.",

    "summary": "Immigrants, particularly Jamaicans, are helping to slow Baltimore's population decline, with almost 2,000 newcomers in one year despite an overall population drop. Steve McMurray, a Jamaican immigrant, exemplifies this trend by establishing a popular Jamaican restaurant that has become a cultural hub in the city.",
    "content": "BALTIMORE\u2014Steve McMurray was not long out of high school when he moved to the United States.\nHe left St. Mary Parish, a rural area in northeastern Jamaica, for trade school in Miami. He spent about a year and a half there, met a Jamaican girl with family in Maryland, and they moved here.\nTheir relationship didn\u2019t last, but he stayed in Baltimore. Now, more than 30 years later, McMurray owns what some say is the best Jamaican restaurant in Baltimore, doubling as an informal cultural center for what the U.S. Census reported as the city\u2019s largest immigrant group.\nBut McMurray isn\u2019t a natural chef. \u201cI\u2019m not a big eater,\u201d he said.\nSteve McMurray is the owner of St. Mary\u2019s Restaurant and Bar in Baltimore. Courtesy of Steve McMurray.\nHe did have entrepreneurial experience, though, having run a small towing company, and thought he could find a market in Baltimore for Jamaican food. So he hired cooks who had more skill, and founded St. Mary\u2019s Restaurant in Charles Village in the late 1990s.\n\u201cIf I have to be in the kitchen, I\u2019ll be sweating,\u201d he said. \u201cI just built it and they came.\u201d\n\u201cThe people love this restaurant,\u201d he said.\nMcMurray is part of a larger trend in the Baltimore area and in Maryland. Baltimore is rapidly losing people, but immigrants continue to move there, helping to stem the population loss.\nBaltimore is one of seven jurisdictions in Maryland in which immigrants prevented or minimized population loss in 2018, according to a Stateline report from April that used 2018 Census data.\nAlmost 2,000 immigrants moved to Baltimore in the 12 months ending July 1, 2018, according to the report, while the overall population dropped by more than 7,300 people. That left the city\u2019s population at just over 602,000.\nAccording to Stateline, a fifth of jurisdictions in the country\u2014many of them post-industrial cities like Baltimore\u2014grew, or shrank less than they would have, because of immigrants. In Maryland, the other jurisdictions were Allegany, Dorchester, Montgomery, Prince George\u2019s, Somerset and Baltimore counties.\nNoel Godfrey, who was the president of the Jamaican Association of Maryland for four years until May, said Jamaicans have been coming to the United States since at least the 1940s.\n\u201cYou can always point to economics or the lack of job opportunities on the island, more to look forward to overseas,\u201d Godfrey said. \u201cJamaicans as a whole are a very ambitious people and they go after what they want.\u201d\nMaryland\u2019s Jamaican diaspora isn\u2019t as big as Miami\u2019s or New York\u2019s, but it is still sizeable. Indeed, three Jamaicans currently serve in the Maryland General Assembly. \nMany Jamaicans, including Godfrey and McMurray, moved to the Baltimore area from bigger, more expensive urban areas. Another is Bengallo Morrison.\nMorrison, who is from the hills outside Kingston, Jamaica, came to this country on a track scholarship to a community college in New Jersey. His speed in the 800 meters and 1500 meters won him another scholarship to finish his bachelor\u2019s degree\u2014and keep running\u2014at Baltimore\u2019s Coppin State University, where more than half of his teammates were from Jamaica.\nHe said his first winter in this country was \u201cterrifying.\u201d He didn\u2019t have a jacket, and someone had to buy warm clothes for him.\nHe has lived in Baltimore and its suburbs ever since. He now lives with his wife, who is also from Jamaica, just south of the city in Anne Arundel County. He flips houses and rents out property.\n\u201cI appreciate that you\u2019re able to do that here,\u201d he said. In Jamaica, \u201copportunities are so scarce.\u201d \nBaltimore\u2019s Jamaican community is largely centered in the Park Heights neighborhood in the northwest part of the city, but for generations, immigrants have largely lived in Southeast Baltimore.\n\u201cThe immigrant community has really stabilized Southeast Baltimore,\u201d said Baltimore City Councilman Zeke Cohen, who represents much of the city\u2019s immigrant community.\nCatalina Rodriguez Lima, the director of the Baltimore Mayor\u2019s Office of Immigrant Affairs, said immigrants mainly move where they know people. She said Baltimore is more affordable than many other jurisdictions, which lack some services Baltimore has such as free legal aid. \n\u201cWe as a city are very intentional about providing services for immigrants,\u201d she told Capital News Service. \u201cIn Baltimore you can still buy a house; in Baltimore your kid can go to school and have (English language instruction); in Baltimore you can open a business and have access to microlending.\u201d\nAccording to the American Community Survey\u2019s five-year estimate for 2013-2017, 49,565 of the city\u2019s 619,796 residents were immigrants, or about 8%. The survey, which is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, estimates population and other statistics between decennial censuses. \nThat\u2019s a decrease in overall population, and an increase in the number of immigrants: According to an estimate for 2005-2009, an average of 639,337 people lived in Baltimore, including 39,685 immigrants. That\u2019s just over 6%. \nAcross Maryland, about 14% of people are immigrants, including more than 30% of Montgomery County.\nMore than 101,000 immigrants lived in Baltimore County in 2017, accounting for more than 13% of its population.\nIt\u2019s not just a recent trend. Baltimore city\u2019s population has been declining for decades, and its immigrant population has been growing since the 1990s.\nIn the late 1800s through World War I, up to 20% of city residents were immigrants, according to an Abell Foundation report. Most were from Eastern Europe and Italy, including the families of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski. But after World War II, a much lower percentage of residents was foreign-born.\nMaryland\u2019s trends reflect the country\u2019s. According to the Pew Research Center, immigrants represented 13.6% of the United States population in 2017, a steady increase from 4.7% in 1970.\nAfter Jamaica, the top countries of origin among immigrants in the city are China, Mexico and Trinidad.\nRefugees also account for a substantial number of new residents. Baltimore has accepted nearly half of Maryland\u2019s refugees in the past 17 years, according to an analysis of State Department data.\nRodriguez Lima\u2019s office was created in 2015 by former Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake as part of her goal of attracting 10,000 families to the city. Rodriguez Lima, who is from Ecuador, said that office may be one reason immigrants come.\nStill, Baltimore is not the top destination for immigrants in Maryland. About 40% of Maryland\u2019s immigrants live in Montgomery County, and immigrant growth is faster in other suburban jurisdictions than in Baltimore.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really difficult to tell someone to come to Baltimore without some sort of network,\u201d Rodriguez Lima said.\nBut the economy is just as important, if not more so.\nRandy Capps, a demographer at the Migration Policy Institute, said immigrants follow construction, and there isn\u2019t as much construction in Baltimore as in the surrounding counties. And the industrial jobs Baltimore lost in the mid-20th century weren\u2019t replaced.\n\u201c(Baltimore) just never had a magnet to attract a new wave of immigrants,\u201d he said.\nHe said the strength of the research and healthcare industries in Baltimore\u2014anchored by Johns Hopkins University and the University of Maryland, Baltimore\u2014combined with the weaker service and construction industries, mean Baltimore\u2019s immigrant population tends to be better-educated than those of other areas. \nWhile Baltimore is losing people, most jurisdictions in Maryland are growing, especially suburban counties. Baltimore saw a net loss of about 1,200 white people and about 17,000 black people between 2010 and 2018, Census data show. Many say they leave because of crime, the quality of the schools and the city\u2019s relatively high property tax rate.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 With a crowd of protesters just outside of the building, the justices of the nation\u2019s highest court heard arguments Tuesday that may determine the fate of a popular program that protected young immigrants from deportation.\nAt issue is whether a program called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was properly terminated in 2017 by the administration of President Donald Trump.\nThe program, created in 2012 by an executive order of President Barack Obama, was aimed at shielding from deportation some 700,000 people who came into the United States illegally as children.\nBut Trump\u2019s Department of Homeland Security and its attorneys have argued that the Obama action was illegal and wrongly required the government to suspend its normal policies against illegal immigration.\n\u201cAfter all, the Department of Homeland Security is a law enforcement agency, and a law enforcement agency doesn\u2019t have to push its dubious power to not enforce the law to its logical extreme,\u201d Solicitor General Noel Francisco told the justices.\nBut Theodore Olson, a former solicitor general representing those challenging the Trump administration\u2019s action, said \u201ctermination of DACA triggered abrupt, tangible, adverse consequences and substantial disruptions in the lives of 700,000 individuals, their families, employers, communities, and Armed Forces.\u201d\n\u201cThat decision required the government to provide an accurate, reasoned, rational, and legally sound explanation. It utterly failed to do so,\u201d he said.\nOne of the two main disputes at the center of the case was whether the government\u2019s decision to end DACA violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), a federal law that set standards for agency actions, requiring that they not be arbitrary or capricious.\n\u201cThat decision did not violate APA for two reasons,\u201d said Francisco said. \u201cFirst, it\u2019s not subject to judicial review\u2026 Second, the decision to end this non-enforcement policy was eminently reasonable.\u201d\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg raised what she called a \u201cstrange element\u201d to Fransico\u2019s argument regarding the department\u2019s discretion to terminate DACA.\n\u201cHow can it be committed to your discretion when you\u2019re saying we have no discretion; this is an illegal program?\u201d Ginsburg asked.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor, an Obama appointee, also questioned the clarity of the government\u2019s reasons for ending the program\u2026\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole lot of reliance interests that weren\u2019t looked at, including the\u2026 current president telling DACA-eligible people that they were safe under him and that he would find a way to keep them here,\u201d Sotomayer said. \u201cAnd so he hasn\u2019t and, instead, he\u2019s done this. And that, I think, has something to be considered before you rescind a policy. \u201c\nJustice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee, said the justices were looking for the right balance in deciding what agency actions are reviewable and what are discretionary and thus out of the purview of the courts.\n\u201cI hear a lot of facts, sympathetic facts, you put out there, and they speak to all of us,\u201d Gorsuch told Olsen. \u201cWhat\u2019s the limiting principle?\u201d\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, also a Trump appointee, said that \u201cregardless of whether these concerns about the DACA policy rendered it illegal or legally questionable, there are sound reasons of enforcement policy to rescind the DACA policy. And (a Homeland Security Department memo) goes on to explain the policy rationales to rescind it.\u201d\nThe court is expected to rule next year, in the middle of the 2020 presidential race.\nMeanwhile, across the street, congressional Democrats urged their Republican colleagues in the Senate to pass legislation making the DACA program permanent.\n\u201cThis is an important day,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said at a press conference with the House Hispanic Caucus and a number of DREAMERS. \u201cAnd we hope and pray that the courts will do the right thing, the All-American thing.\u201d\nTrump tweeted before the court arguments that \u201cmany of the people in DACA, no longer very young, are far from \u2018angels.\u2019 Some are very tough, hardened criminals.\u201d\nThat is false: to qualify as a DACA recipient, an undocumented immigrant may not have a criminal record.\nThousands of DACA recipients and supporters rallied in frigid temperatures outside of the Supreme Court as the hearing took place.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to go another year without receiving an answer,\u201d said Gabriela Hernandez, a 20-year-old DACA recipient who came to the United States when she was 15. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be kept in a limbo because this is our actual lives.\u201d\nHernandez came with Maryland-based organization CASA to show her support for the program. She said several groups camped outside of the court the night before, while others traveled from as far as Pennsylvania, New York, and California to take part.\nAmong the groups was The \u201cHome Is Here\u201d March, which kicked off a 16-day walk to the court from New York in October and arrived Monday night. Roughly 200 people signed up to make the journey.\nThe Washington Ethical Society, a local congregation, also came to the rally to stand in solidarity for DACA.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to make a statement that is visible. Not only here in Washington, but hopefully, the rest of the country,\u201d said Wayne Milsestuem, a member of the congregation.\n\u201cThe goal was really just to show that we\u2019re going to put a face to the millions of people they think don\u2019t have to give an answer and we\u2019re going to demand an answer this time,\u201d Hernandez said.",

Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, are among 51 senators and 123 House members who filed a bipartisan amicus brief in support of DACA.\u00a0\n\u201cThe DACA program and Dreamers prove that it is possible to be both fair and compassionate, and that this country is best when we insist on being both,\u201d Cardin said.\nIn the months leading up to the hearing, which is scheduled for next Tuesday, other briefs expressed similar views on the harm that terminating DACA could cause.\nThe Presidents\u2019 Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration, a coalition of college and university leaders, argued that supporting DACA is \u201ccentral to our mission as educators,\u201d and that they are \u201cdevoted to the education of people to help them realize their ambitions and potential, and to contribute to their communities, to this country, and to the world.\u201d\u00a0\nA group of 127 religious organizations also filed a brief, stating that their communities \u201cstand to lose the tremendous investment made over many years to bring DACA recipients into adulthood with skills and multicultural perspectives that are sorely needed by the larger community and the nation.\u201d\nIn a letter advising the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to end the program in 2017, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions stated that DACA was \u201can unconstitutional exercise of authority by the Executive Branch\u201d and was implemented \u201cwithout proper statutory authority.\u201d\u00a0\nThis has been the main argument of the government against the Regents of the University of California. That university, whose president, Janet Napolitano, was President Barack Obama\u2019s homeland security secretary, filed suit three days after the announcement that DACA would be terminated. UC said it sued the government \u201cfor wrongly and unconstitutionally violating the rights of the University and its students.\u201d\nTrump recently took to Twitter, urging the Supreme Court to strike down the immigration program, tweeting that leaving DACA intact would grant \u201cextraordinary powers\u201d to a president.\nThe president has also repeated claims that Obama had admitted to DACA being unconstitutional during a Rose Garden speech in 2012. According to Politifact, such claims had no basis.\u00a0\nDoug Pennington, spokesman for the Constitutional Accountability Center, a Washington-based progressive think tank, told Capital News Service that Trump\u2019s claims that the law is on his side regarding DACA \u201cis completely false.\u201d\n\u201cCongress has long recognized that the executive branch must have discretion to determine how best to enforce the nation\u2019s immigration laws \u2013 discretion that has been repeatedly upheld by the Supreme Court,\u201d Pennington said.\nDACA was created in 2012 by Obama as a means of providing immigrants who came to the United States as children the ability to work and live in the country without fear of being deported.\nFive years later, the Trump administration announced that it would be rescinding the protections in September 2017.\nSeveral lawsuits were filed against the federal government stating that its handling of DACA was unlawful. In July, the Supreme Court finally agreed to review these legal challenges and is expected to make a decision by next June.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s upended a lot of people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Nicholas Katz, senior manager of the legal program for CASA, a Maryland-based immigration advocacy group.\nAs one of the largest regional providers of DACA services, CASA filed its own lawsuit against DHS about a month after the announcement to rescind the program was made. According to Katz, their litigation won in every court it was heard in. But despite the victories, there have been no new applications for the program since 2017.\u00a0\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see hundreds of thousands of people in support of DACA outside of the court,\u201d Katz said, anticipating the hearing. \u201cI hope to see the justices engaging with our attorneys and that they see that the faces in the room are going to be affected by their decision.\u201d\u00a0\nKatz added that although he hopes the Supreme Court upholds the legality of DACA, that alone won\u2019t be enough to provide real security for undocumented individuals.\u00a0\n\u201cWe need a legislative solution\u2026 The fight continues,\u201d he said.\nDACA supporters mounted a march to Washington on Oct. 26 at the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. The march is slated to conclude at the Supreme Court Tuesday as the arguments get underway.",

    "summary": "Congress is considering removing the term \"illegal alien\" from federal laws and regulations, as part of an ongoing effort to eliminate offensive language; however, the bill faces more challenges compared to similar legislation passed in 2016 that removed terms like \u201coriental\u201d and \u201cnegro.\u201d President Trump's increased use of \"illegal alien\" has been criticized for demonizing immigrant communities and stoking fear.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Just three years ago, the words \u201coriental\u201d and \u201cnegro\u201d were removed from federal laws and regulations, after a bill to ban the offensive words unanimously passed Congress.\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, pushed the legislation through, under the premise that words matter, and can cause harm and division.\nAnother attempt to change the federal government\u2019s vocabulary is underway, but unlike its predecessor in 2016, the bill seems far less likely to fly through Congress.\nThe term proposed for the chopping block is \u201cillegal alien,\u201d under legislation sponsored by Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas.\nThe phrase refers to noncitizens who are in the country without proper authorization, and fell mostly out of use with politicians until last year, when President Donald Trump amped up his use of the term to refer to all unauthorized immigrants.\nThe word cloud below highlights which words Trump most frequently says around his use of the word \u201calien,\u201d based on an analysis by Capital News Service.\n\nAccording to Factba.se, which tracks all of Trump\u2019s public comments, Trump only used \u201cillegal alien\u201d a handful of times on the campaign trail in 2015, although he was talking about illegal immigration almost every day. Even throughout the first year of his presidency, Trump only said \u201cillegal alien\u201d three times in public comments.\nBut last year, the president\u2019s use of the term skyrocketed to a whopping 123 times in tweets, speeches and political rallies, a CNS analysis shows. He\u2019s used it 58 times this year.\n\nAnd Google searches for the term have also seen spikes.\n \nOtto Santa Ana, professor of linguistics at UCLA, said \u201cillegal alien\u201d is used intentionally by the president to strike fear into the hearts of Americans and push his immigration agenda. It demonizes immigrant communities, he said, and tries to make a powerful nation fear the powerless.\nWhen we use \u2018illegal aliens\u2019 to refer to immigrants, we place them in a different category than ourselves, Santa Ana said. \u201cThey are no longer people that need to be considered the way we would consider Tom and Mary Jones from Orange County, California. It\u2019s easy to conceptualize them as a horror, as dangerous, as inferior, as someone who will destroy the fabric of American society.\u201d\nIt\u2019s why Castro introduced the legislation, which would change any reference to \u201cillegal alien\u201d or \u201calien\u201d in any federal statute, rule, regulation, executive order, publication or any other federal document to \u201cforeign national\u201d or \u201cundocumented foreign national.\u201d\n\u201cWords matter,\u201d Castro said in a statement about the Correcting Hurtful and Alienating Names in Government Expression (CHANGE) Act. \u201cThe words \u2018alien\u2019 and \u2018illegal alien\u2019 work to demonize and dehumanize the migrant community. They should have no place in our government\u2019s description of human beings.\u201d\nBut opponents of the change say using new \u201cfeel-good terms\u201d like \u201cunauthorized\u201d or \u201cundocumented\u201d immigrant push an open borders agenda and create the false impression that an immigrant\u2019s undocumented status is the U.S. government\u2019s fault, for perhaps taking too long to authorize them, or making an administrative error in their paperwork.\n\u201cThe immigration process isn\u2019t like applying for a municipal parking permit or a library card \u2013 it is much more complex,\u201d Matt O\u2019Brien, of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), told Capital News Service in an email.\n\u201cAnd it is a complicated process because it involves vetting people from all over the world in order to determine whether they present a threat to the economy, public safety and national security of the United States,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\nFAIR said \u201calien\u201d has been used for hundreds of years as a neutral term to describe someone who is a foreigner.\nJust last month, New York City\u2019s Commission on Human Rights issued guidance banning the use of \u201cillegal alien\u201d or \u201cillegals\u201d when the terms are meant to \u201cdemean, humiliate or harass a person.\u201d Discrimination on the basis of immigration status and national origin has been illegal for decades, but the commission said that with 37% of New York\u2019s population being born outside of the United States, the directive ensures immigrant communities are protected against discrimination.\nViolation of the law, which covers workplace harassment, tenants\u2019 rights and public accommodation, can result in a fine of up to $250,000.\nIn April 2013, the Associated Press revised its guidelines to abandon \u201calien\u201d and \u201cillegal alien\u201d in news stories and instead encouraged journalists to specify how someone entered the country and from where.\nFor example, an unauthorized immigrant may have been brought to the United States against their will, such as a victim of sex trafficking. Some might have come under \u201ctemporary protected status\u201d because of turmoil in their home country, and the government later removed their protected status. And it\u2019s estimated that about half of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. came here legally, but overstayed their visas.\n\u201cThe term is a problem because you would think if someone is an illegal alien, that means they are all in the same boat,\u201d Shahid Haque, an immigration lawyer in Montana, said, adding that \u201cillegal alien\u201d is overly simplistic and legally inaccurate. He also said the word can do a lot of harm in the way immigrants are treated.\n\u201cIt allows characterization of a large group of people to be less entitled to compassion or dignity,\u201d Haque said. \u201cIt allows people to dehumanize the immigrants themselves and cast their entire existence as illegal.\u201d\n\u201cThe broader the term is used, the more it\u2019s meant to demonize immigrants and portray them as criminals,\u201d he said.\nMost immigrants aren\u2019t criminals. Because crossing the border without authorization is a misdemeanor, but overstaying a visa is a civil infraction, a migrant\u2019s unauthorized presence in the United States is not a criminal offense.\nAnd the notion that immigrants are dangerous has been dashed by several studies showing both legal and illegal immigration does not lead to rising crime. While 6% of U.S. citizens are felons, only 2% of immigrants are felons.\nBut \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d is an even more frequent phrase in Trump\u2019s vocabulary than \u201cillegal aliens.\u201d\nThe president used \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d 53 times in 2016, 26 times in 2017 and 112 times in 2018 in tweets, political rallies and speeches, according to Factba.se. He has used it 44 times this year.\n\nObviously, the Castro bill cannot correct the president\u2019s vocabulary \u2013 it would simply eliminate references to aliens from federal documents.\nCritics insist that effort is wrong and misplaced.\n\u201cIf certain members of our legislature dislike our immigration laws, they should propose meaningful changes,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\n\u201cBut putting forward silly legislation that proscribes the use of standard legal terminology is pointless and shows a stunning lack of willingness to engage in serious debate aimed at formulating wise immigration policies.\u201d he said.\nStill, language matters to supporters of the bill.\n\u201cWhat you see is what you get,\u201d Santa Ana said. \u201cWe construct our world in terms of the way we label things.\u201d",

    "content": "BALTIMORE\u2014Maryland organizations criticized as \u201ccynical\u201d and \u201castounding\u201d the Thursday decision by the Trump Administration to decrease the national refugee admissions ceiling to its lowest level ever.\nThe cap for fiscal 2020 will be 18,000 refugees, down from the ceiling of 110,000 set by President Obama in 2017, according to a news release from the State Department. The decision also allows cities and states to opt out of accepting refugees.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a cynical renunciation of U.S. humanitarian commitment,\u201d Betty Symington, the executive director of the Episcopal Refugee and Immigrant Center Alliance, told Capital News Service. Symington described the decision as \u201cpart and parcel of a multifaceted attack on immigrants in general.\u201d\nSymington, whose organization supports refugees and other immigrants with housing, emergency assistance, education and other services, said, \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated situation but also a very simple one. Unfortunately, we\u2019re not surprised.\u201d\nThe 18,000 figure represents the lowest level since the 1980 Refugee Act \u2014 which established procedures for acceptance and resettlement \u2014 and is fewer than in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.\nGeorge Escobar, the chief of programs for CASA de Maryland, called the decision \u201castounding,\u201d \u201coutrageous,\u201d and \u201cfrustrating.\u201d He said it was part of the president\u2019s \u201cxenophobic and racist\u201d immigration policy.\nHe said refugees have enjoyed bipartisan support, which means refugee organizations have not had to advocate for themselves as strongly as groups like CASA de Maryland, which advocates for immigrants with and without documentation.\n\u201cThey\u2019re stepping up and joining the broader immigrant fight,\u201d Escobar said.\nPresident Trump has decreased the ceiling four times in a row. The Obama and Bush administrations kept it around 70,000 to 80,000 for most years, reaching a high point of 110,000 during fiscal 2017.\nThe Trump Administration cut it to 50,000 in 2017, then to 45,000 in fiscal 2018, and to 30,000 in fiscal 2019. The New York Times and other outlets reported this month that the president was considering ending refugee admissions altogether.\nIn a statement, Krish O\u2019Mara Vignarajah, the president and CEO of Baltimore-based Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said, \u201cCommunities and people of faith across the country are deeply disturbed by this unwarranted decision to turn our backs to those most in need.\u201d\nThe State Department told the country\u2019s nine refugee resettlement agencies, which the government funds, that they may not all receive funding this year.\n\u201cAt the core of the Trump Administration\u2019s foreign policy is a commitment to make decisions based on reality, not wishes, and to drive optimal outcomes based on concrete facts,\u201d the State Department news release said.\nThe agency cited foreign aid and asylum cases among other methods of humanitarian assistance granted by the United States, which it called \u201cthe most compassionate and generous nation in history.\u201d\n\u201cIt is misguided to see our refugee admissions program as the singular measure of America\u2019s humanitarian-based immigration efforts,\u201d the State Department release said.\nRuben Chandrasekar, the director of the Baltimore office of the International Rescue Committee, said the group will \u201cmost likely\u201d face layoffs. But how his office will be affected \u201cremains to be seen.\u201d\n\u201cAt a time when there\u2019s a global refugee crisis, the U.S. is withdrawing increasingly so from addressing this crisis,\u201d Chandrasekar said.\n\u201cI pray that we won\u2019t have to plan for layoffs,\u201d Vignarajah, who ran for governor in 2018, told Capital News Service.\nPaul Spiegel, who directs the Center for Humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins University, said even that high number\u2014110,000\u2014is not very high.\n\u201cThe burden of refugees is not on the high-income countries,\u201d Spiegel said. Wealthy nations, he said, accept about 1% of the world\u2019s refugees; most of the rest are in countries neighboring those refugees are fleeing. \u201cBeyond a moral obligation to help these people, there\u2019s also an obligation to share the burden.\u201d\nSpiegel said the decision will damage the reputation of the United States as a \u201cbeacon for welcoming vulnerable people.\u201d\nHe said many oppose refugee admissions based on a belief that they take more than they contribute to society. He said refugees are not \u201csolely victims,\u201d and many studies have shown refugees are not a financial burden on the countries that accept them.\nDavid Milliband, the president and CEO of the International Rescue Committee, one of the most prominent refugee resettlement agencies, said in a statement that \u201cthis is a very sad day for America.\u201d\n\u201cThis decision represents further damage to America\u2019s leadership on protecting the most vulnerable people around the world,\u201d he stated. \u201cIt has no basis in logic or need, damages America\u2019s interests, and tarnishes her values.\u201d\nFor five years in a row, and for seven of the past nine, Maryland has taken in a greater share of the country\u2019s refugees than its portion of the country\u2019s population.\nMaryland accounts for about 1.85% of the population of the United States, but in fiscal 2019, the state accepted 2.8% of all refugees admitted to the country, according to a Capital News Service analysis of data from the Refugee Processing Center, which is operated by the State Department.\nThose cuts have affected all states, but Maryland has accepted a greater share of the refugee population each year since 2016.\nMaryland accepted 1,653 refugees in 2016, according to the Refugee Processing Center, which accounted for 1.94% of the refugees the country took. In 2018, the state accepted 465. The state accepted 684 in Fiscal Year 2019, making up 2.77% of the country\u2019s refugees for the year.\nMore refugees have come to Maryland from the Democratic Republic of the Congo than from any other country in recent years. The state has also accepted many from Burma, Bhutan and Eritrea.\nMaryland accepted about 10% of all Eritrean refugees in 2019. And even though more refugees came to Maryland from the Congo from any other country, fewer than 1% of Congolese refugees resettled in the U.S. came to Maryland.\nBaltimore, where the population is near a 100-year low, has accepted nearly half of Maryland\u2019s refugees since 2000.\n\u201cThe city needs residents,\u201d Symington said. \u201cThe city needs people to come and put down roots.\u201d\nMore than 15% of Marylanders are immigrants, and another 11% are native-born U.S. citizens with at least one immigrant parent, according to the American Immigration Council.\nIn 2012, Maryland had the eighth-highest share of immigrants among U.S. states, according to the Pew Research Center. Much of the growth of the state\u2019s immigrant population has come since 2000, when less than 10% of Marylanders were immigrants. More of Maryland\u2019s immigrants are from El Salvador than any other country.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Migrant children who were separated from their parents will most likely deal with that trauma for the rest of their lives, a federal official told a congressional hearing Wednesday.\n\u201cThe consequences of separation for many of these children will be lifelong,\u201d Jonathan White, Commander of the Public Health Service Commissioned Corps for the Health and Human Services Department told ranking members of several House appropriations subcommittees. \u201cIt is severe and difficult to manage even with high levels of clinical care.\u201d\nIn 2018, President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance policy\u201d on the Mexican border that created a new population of children being referred to facilities in the Office of Refugee Resettlement, which takes care of unaccompanied migrant children until they are released into the custody of a sponsor, usually a vetted family member.\u00a0\nBut according to a recent watchdog report from the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general, the facilities were ill-equipped to handle the influx.\nSignificant increases in young children exacerbated the challenges of caring for youth who had just traveled thousands of miles, and who had already experienced significant trauma in their home countries and on their journey to the United States, according to the report.\nBut those that were separated from their parents suffered more.\n\u201cEvery heartbeat hurts.\u201d \u201cMy chest hurts.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t feel my heart.\u201d\u00a0\nThese were frequent ways children described their pain, according to a medical director of one of the refugee resettlement facilities.\u00a0\u00a0\nChildren who had been separated from their parents experienced more fear, feelings of abandonment, anxiety and guilt, than children who had not, the inspector general\u2019s report said. And longer stays in the facilities \u2013 due to increased screening requirements for sponsors \u2013 led to more instances of suicidal thoughts and self-harm.\u00a0\n\u201cEven children who were outgoing and personable started getting frustrated and concerned around their 70th day in care,\u201d the report said, as a child\u2019s average length of stay in custody almost tripled after the policy change, reaching a high of 93 days in November 2018.\u00a0\nRep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, said the committee found the report \u201calarming.\u201d\u00a0\n\u201cIt confirms our worst fears, that intentional policy choices by this administration created what I would call a mental health crisis,\u201d DeLauro said.\nSince the Trump administration ended the widely-criticized zero-tolerance policy and rolled back screening requirements for sponsors, the number of young children and length of stay both decreased in refugee facilities.\u00a0\nBut it\u2019s still hard to find enough bilingual mental health clinicians to manage demanding caseloads of 12-25 children with severe mental health trauma, especially in rural areas, according to staff interviewed for the report.\nClinicians also reported difficulties in addressing mental health concerns when it was uncertain how long the child would be in their care.\u00a0\nAnd separations still occur. In the past year, 911 children were separated from their parents, the New York Times reported. More than half were under the age of 10, and 185 were five or younger.\nMost of the time, separation occurs because the Border Patrol is skeptical of the safety of the child, though Lee Gelernt of the American Civil Liberties Union told the Times that most of the criminal history the agency cites is either wrong or shockingly minor.\u00a0\nChildren are also separated from their extended families, which has long been federal law in order to mitigate trafficking. The government has not said how many children are separated from grandparents, aunts and uncles, and older siblings at the border, the Associated Press reported.\nWhite said it\u2019s impossible to build a program that can respond to the needs of separated children.\u00a0\n\u201cThe only way to address their trauma is prevention,\u201d he said. He urged members of the committee to pass a bill to define what conditions, if any, would allow children to be separated from their parents.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cThat is a gap in law,\u201d White said.\u00a0\nBased on recommendations from the report, the Department of Health and Human Services already has hired more mental health clinicians, is working to provide additional funding for staff retention, and is developing a webinar to train staff on trauma in unaccompanied children, Jonathan Hayes, Director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement told committee members.\nDeLauro said that in addition to the recommendations proposed by the inspector general, the administration needs to end the memorandum of agreement between the Department of Homeland Security and the Health and Human Services, which requires the refugee resettlement office to share personal information from sponsors with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, causing a sponsor shortage.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cChildren did not just arrive at our border,\u201d DeLauro said. \u201cThey suffered at our hands, and they are suffering still due to the long term mental health trauma. That is not something we can ignore or sweep under the rug.\u201d",

The bill seeks to counter Trump administration policies that have sought to end protections for these groups.",
    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 In a rebuke to rollbacks issued by the Trump administration, House Democrats introduced the Dream and Promise Act Tuesday, which would afford protection to millions of undocumented residents.\nThe proposed bill, H.R.6, would provide a direct path to permanent residence to approximately 3.6 million immigrants brought into the United States as minors, also called DREAMers. \n\u201cThe American people are overwhelmingly for this legislation,\u201d House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, said in a press briefing. \u201cWe hope that many of our Republican friends will join us.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump announced in September 2017 that he was planning to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. The future of the program remains uncertain. While new applicants can no longer apply, existing recipients are allowed to renew their status as the issue is litigated in the courts. \nThe ambitious bill also calls for a pathway to permanent residence for recipients of the Temporary Restricted Status (TRS) and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) programs. Immigrants under these programs came from countries considered unsafe due to natural disaster, civil war or other factors. \nThe Trump administration has removed TRS status for several countries, and DED status is set to expire for others, although an injunction is currently in place against those actions. The bill would also cancel any pending removal proceedings for TRS and DED recipients. \n\nVideo by Julia Kim & Makea Luzader\nThe bill is co-sponsored by Reps. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-California, Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez, D-New York, and Yvette Clarke, D-New York. \n \u201cThese young people\u2026are American in every sense but on paper,\u201d Vel\u00e1zquez said in a press conference outside the United States Capitol following the bill\u2019s introduction. \u201cThe issue that we are addressing today speaks to who we are as a nation.\u201d \nEarlier Tuesday, House Democrats, along with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-California,\u00a0and Hoyer, announced the bill at a press event.\n\u201cWe are here to pledge our efforts,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cI am here as majority leader to pledge that this bill is going to be on the floor.\u201d\nSeveral undocumented immigrants were at the Capitol to witness the bill\u2019s official unveiling.\n\u201cThe Dream and Promise Act shows us a completely different path forward on immigration,\u201d said Greisa Martinez, deputy executive director of United We Dream, the country\u2019s largest immigrant youth-led organization. \u201c(It\u2019s) one that leads us into a pathway of protection without hurting other immigrants.\u201d \nThe Democrats took control of the House in January for the first time since 2010. One of the last bills they passed that year was the DREAM Act, which was more limited in scope: it would have provided protection to only about half of undocumented youth, and did not address TRS or DED.\nHouse leaders said the new sweeping bill reinforces Democrats\u2019 commitment to fighting Trump administration policies against immigration and demonstrates a party consensus on the issue.\n\u201cI think you\u2019ve seen a party that\u2019s been very unified over the last two-and-a-half months,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cWe are very united when we come to the floor and vote on issues.\u201d\nProspects for the Democrats\u2019 proposal in the Republican-controlled Senate are uncertain at best.",

Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen joined immigrants rights activists on Thursday to unveil new legislation to protect undocumented immigrants living under Temporary Protected Status.\n\u201cCongress needs to pass legislation,\u201d Cardin said at a Capitol Hill news conference. \u201cWe need to get predictability and safety to people who are in uncertain status.\u201d\nAlong with Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, the senators are proposing a bill called the SECURE Act, or Safe Environment from Countries Under Repression and in Emergency Act, which would make immigrants under \u201cTemporary Protected Status\u201d eligible to apply for legal permanent residency after three years.\nTemporary protected status (TPS) is granted to immigrants for whom returning to their home countries is dangerous and impossible. There are approximately 437,000 TPS holders from 10 designated countries currently living in the United States, including 22,500 in Maryland.\nThe Department of Homeland Security identifies three conditions for which temporary protected status is granted: \u201congoing armed conflict (such as civil war), an environmental disaster (such as earthquake or hurricane), or an epidemic\u201d or any other \u201cextraordinary and temporary conditions.\u201d\n\u00a0\n\u201cMany of the individuals here under TPS have been here for as long as two decades- two decades,\u201d Van Hollen said. \u201cThese are families. These are moms and dads. They\u2019re people who are working in businesses, and they\u2019re people who have started successful small businesses.\u201d\nHe called deporting such immigrants \u201cwrong and counterproductive.\u201d\n\u201cThis legislation is very simple,\u201d Van Hollen said. \u201cIt says we should not be deporting these individuals who are contributing so much to our country to places that are dangerous and will put their lives at risk.\u201d\nA coalition of immigrants rights advocates from MomsRising, the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Herd on the Hill, Mormon Women for Ethical Governance, UndocuBlack and CASA was present to lend support as several immigrants shared their stories.\n\u201cThe American Dream is not only given to a certain group of people but to everybody,\u201d said Cindy Kolade, a Baltimore resident and undocumented immigrant.\nKolade is a DACA-recipient, the program under which undocumented young people became eligible for work permits, and a member of UndocuBlack, an organization that works to support undocumented black immigrants. She was emotional as she spoke of her experiences in the United States since arriving from the Ivory Coast when she was 12 years old.\n\u201cAll we know is America,\u201d she said. \u201cGoing back is not going to help us or America.\u201d\nAfter the conclusion of the press conference, part of the group planned to deliver Thanksgiving-themed cookies to lawmakers on the Hill alongside petitions in support of the DREAM Act and SECURE Act.\nThe senators urged Congress to pass both their legislation and a \u201cclean DREAM Act\u201d to protect the hundreds of thousands of children of undocumented immigrants in the United States. President Donald Trump has said he is terminating the program protecting those children, many of whom are now adults.\n\u201cYes, we want the president of the United States to do the right thing,\u201d Cardin said. \u201cYes, we want to make sure that we extend TPS so that we protect the status of those who are under that program. But only Congress can provide the permanent relief, the certainty that\u2019s needed to take away the fear in families.\u201d",

    "content": "WASHINGTON \u2013 More than two months after President Donald Trump said he was ending protections to children brought to the United States by undocumented immigrants, demonstrators on Thursday swamped a Senate building to pressure lawmakers to vote for a renewal of the program.\nHundreds of people wore orange t-shirts, passed out just before entering the Hart Senate Office Building, that read \u201cClean DREAM Act Now,\u201d reflecting the goal to press for a permanent solution to the uncertainty of their immigration status in the United States.\nGustavo Minaya, one of the demonstrators, came from Baltimore, Maryland, for the day. Minaya arrived undocumented in the United States from Peru with his mother when he was just 5 years old.\n\u201cIt was a two-month journey, and thankfully we survived and that, with the immigration reform of the 1980s, we had a path to citizenship,\u201d Minaya said. \u201cI\u2019m very privileged because of that, and I know there\u2019s people who don\u2019t have that opportunity. That\u2019s why I\u2019m fighting for their human rights.\u201d\nThe demonstrators gathered in droves to fill the atrium of the Hart building with the promise that immigrants are \u201chere to stay,\u201d unfurling banners from balconies and chanting loudly.\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know this was happening but I\u2019m just so excited about it. This is fantastic,\u201d said Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California, as she stood in the atrium, raising her right fist in a show of solidarity. \u201cDemocracy is shouting right now. Keep fighting.\u201d\nNot far away, a group of Democratic lawmakers held a press conference about how vital those under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program are to the Nation\u2019s armed forces and the rest of society.\nHouse Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer of Mechanicsville, Maryland, said he would continue to work with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Democratic caucus to bring the DREAM Act to the floor for a vote.\n\u201cAs we approach Veterans Day, Congressional Democrats continue to stand with Dreamers, including those who serve our nation in uniform and who are critical to our national security,\u201d Hoyer said in statement.\n\u201cTheir patriotism and determination in the face of uncertainty, created by President Trump\u2019s irresponsible order to end the DACA program, are inspiring,\u201d the congressman said.\n\u201cRight now we have more than 800 Dreamers currently serving in the United States military who signed enlistment contracts and are waiting basic training,\u201d Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin of Illinois said during the press conference.\n\u201cThese brave men and women raised their hand to serve and lay down their lives if necessary,\u201d the senator said. \u201cThis is the only country they know. If Congress fails to pass the Dream Act, these young people could be forced to leave the military and be placed at risk of being deported from a country they have volunteered to serve.\u201d\n\u201cThese are men and women who come to our shores to seek new opportunities, to become doctors, engineers, teachers and scientists,\u201d said fellow Illinois Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, who served in the military for more than 20 years. \u201cSome of them even choose to risk their lives to protect our freedoms as members of our uniform services. And the sacrifices aren\u2019t just admirable it\u2019s heroic.\u201d\nDuckworth said that the United States can not afford to turn away \u201cDreamers\u201d and the future of the military, economy and national security depends on them.\nThe demonstrators at Hart criticized President Donald Trump for rescinding DACA. Many of those gathered were students from the Washington metropolitan area. Some also arrived on buses from states as far away as New York and Florida.\n\u201cWhat the administration did by repealing DACA has pretty much affected all the youth that is here,\u201d Jose Aguiluz said outside the Hart building as the demonstrators reassembled to march through the streets on Capitol Hill.\nAguiluz is a DACA recipient living in Silver Spring, Maryland, who arrived from Honduras when he was 15. He has worked across the state to support other undocumented immigrants, even before the DACA program even began under President Barack Obama in 2012.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been living in fear, not knowing what\u2019s going to happen, but this is what happens when people mobilize,\u201d Aguiluz said. \u201cWe are very, very excited, and we are very pushy. You can feel the energy of the people. It was an unprecedented action that we took here.\u201d\nSo far, no legislation has been scheduled for consideration in Congress.",

    "content": "LANGLEY PARK, Maryland \u2014 As the deadline to apply for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, expired Thursday, program participants and immigrants-rights activists gathered to share stories and announce that they will continue the fight to stay in their home, America.\nOfficials at CASA announced they will sue the federal government over the elimination of the DACA program, which has given two-year renewable work permits to more than 800,000 immigrants who came into the United States as minors since the immigration policy was instituted in 2012.\nCASA is the largest DACA-service provider in the state \u2014 headquartered in Langley Park, Maryland \u2014 and provides legal assistance and support to immigrants.\nCASA and its legal team are suing the Trump Administration on the basis that the government did not follow proper procedures in dismantling the program and was \u201cmotivated by an unconstitutional racial animus against Mexican and Central American DACA beneficiaries,\u201d according to Fernanda Durand, CASA\u2019s communications manager.\n\u201cAnd this is one step in a long fight,\u201d said CASA\u2019s Executive Director Gustavo Torres. \u201cCASA has been fighting (alongside) the dreamers for many years.\u201d\nAccording to Durand, DACA participants \u2014 also known as dreamers \u2014 come from many different countries but the majority are Mexican and Central Americans, hence the specification within the lawsuit.\nIf one\u2019s DACA benefits expired before Sept. 5 or after March 5, 2018, they are not eligible for renewal and are subject to potential deportation, according to Jonathan Smith, a lawyer on CASA\u2019s legal team from Washington Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs.\nMissael Garcia, a 27-year-old DACA recipient for the past two years, led a group of about 20 hopeful-dreamers in chants and songs that represented their cause. Garcia continuously raised his fist in the air and chanted, \u201cSi, se puede,\u201d \u2014 yes we can.\nGarcia did not share why, but he was unable to renew his status. According to CASA\u2019s legal team, many immigrants can\u2019t renew either because of the time restraint or because they are unable to pay the $495 fee to renew every two years.\n\u201cMy baby was literally born yesterday, so I am a new dad you know, joining the club of daddies. I think that being stable in this country with legal status is going to help me a lot to support my child now and I feel more determined to fight for her, fight for myself, for my situation and not just for mine, but for everybody in general.\u201d\nOther DACA recipients who shared their stories include Maricruz Abarca, a 32-year-old business owner and mother of three who came to the U.S. when she was 15, and Estefany Rodriguez, a 20-year-old dreamer who suffers from brain cancer.\n\u201cEven though I am on a walker now, I will walk again,\u201d Rodriguez said confidently while other dreamers held her at the podium.\nAbarca received her GED in June 2016 after countless hours of studying, has a business license and takes classes at Baltimore City Community College in hopes of becoming a lawyer. Following the expiration of DACA, Abarca will no longer be able to continue running her three automotive-related businesses.\n\u201cI cried. I saw my husband, my mother, my kids running towards me and I got this diploma in my hand and that shows them that yes, you can do anything you want and now we want to get this opportunity. We need DACA.\u201d\nDaniella Acosta, a 17-year-old who has been a DACA recipient she was 15, explained that despite the fear of uncertainty that followed the Trump Administration\u2019s decision to end DACA, this lawsuit makes her optimistic.\n\u201cThe plans you had are going to change because now, the opportunity that gave you a vision is took, so definitely everything that you think is one thing is another,\u201d Acosta said. \u201cIt gives you hope. We had the hope and then it was kind of took for a month, but this is giving you more of a chance to feel like DACA will stay and there may be a bigger opportunity for all of us.\u201d\nThe lawsuit is expected to be filed to the U.S. District Court located in Greenbelt, Maryland.\nOther organizations named as plaintiffs in the suit include the Fair Immigration Reform Movement (FIRM), the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of California (CHIRLA), One America, Make the Road Pennsylvania, Michigan United, Arkansas United Community Coalition and the Junta for Progressive Action.",

    "content": "LANGLEY PARK, Maryland\u2014After President Donald Trump\u2019s decision in early September to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, immigrants who need to reapply for DACA protections\u2014in the form of two-year renewable work permits\u2014are quickly running out of time.\nThe government is not accepting new applications and will stop accepting renewal applications on Oct. 5 from immigrants, or \u201cdreamers\u201d as they are often called, whose work permits expire between Sept. 5, 2017, and March 5, 2018. On Sept. 5, Trump gave Congress six months to find a legislative solution to address the program.\nFor the immigrants, there is \u201ca lot of uncertainty, fear as to what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d said Marysabel Rodriguez-Nanney, 47, an immigration lawyer and founder of the law firm Rodriguez-Nanney PA Attorney at Law in Annapolis, Maryland.\nAbout 800,000 young, undocumented immigrants have received work permits and protections from deportation since DACA was created under President Barack Obama in 2012. Roughly 689,000 undocumented immigrants are protected by the program, according to data from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services.\nAs of Sept. 4, there were about 8,100 Marylanders enrolled in the DACA program, which makes up about 1.2 percent of the U.S. total, according to the immigration services data.\nCASA, an immigrants\u2019 rights organization headquartered in Langley Park, Maryland, has been focused on helping immigrants get legal assistance before the deadline.\nCASA operates in Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania and has more than 90,000 members, making it the largest membership-based immigrant\u2019s rights group in the Mid-Atlantic region, Nicholas Katz, senior manager of legal services for CASA, told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service.\nCASA is the largest DACA-service provider in Maryland and over the last five years, CASA has helped more than 3,000 immigrants either initially apply or reapply for DACA, said Katz.\nKatz, 37, who lives in Silver Spring, Maryland, stressed that DACA renewal applications have to be marked as received by Oct. 5, so an application mailed to the immigration services agency on Oct. 5 would not be valid.\nNicholas Katz, senior manager of legal services at CASA, getting ready to meet with immigrants Saturday, September 30, 2017, at CASA\u2019s DACA renewal clinic. (Chris Miller/ Capital News Service)\nCASA has conducted three DACA renewal clinics in Maryland since Trump\u2019s announcement, including one on Saturday at its Langley Park headquarters.\nImmigrants arrived at CASA\u2019s DACA clinic Saturday morning at 10. They signed in, payed a $50 fee and then met with CASA lawyers and trained volunteers who helped them complete their renewal applications.\nCASA lawyers also performed a comprehensive screening to see whether they were eligible for some form of permanent status.\nJorge Gomez, 20, is a student at Prince George\u2019s Community College and lives in Hyattsville, Maryland. He came to the U.S. from Mexico when he was almost 2 and has had DACA protections since 2012. He was one of the first at the clinic Saturday.\nHis two-year work permit expires in January.\nHe said he believes organizations like CASA are essential.\n\u201cIt would be more difficult to renew my DACA without CASA,\u201d he said. \u201cYou feel better knowing you have CASA to help you out because they understand where you\u2019re coming from.\u201d\nGomez is enrolled in the National External Diploma Program at the college, where he is earning his high school diploma.\nJorge Gomez, 20, a student at Prince George\u2019s Community College comes to CASA\u2019s DACA renewal clinic Saturday, September 30, 2017, to complete his renewal application. (Chris Miller/ Capital News Service)\nEliseo Magos, 23, lives in Capitol Heights, Maryland, and is a DACA dreamer originally from Mexico. He works for CASA as a DACA promoter.\nThe DACA clinics are helpful, he said, because they are much more affordable than seeking official legal help.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t charge the same as official lawyers,\u201d Magos said, noting that CASA only requires the $50 fee.\nImani Cherry, a 26-year-old law student at American University in Washington, volunteered at the clinic Saturday.\n\u201cOur school is big on human rights,\u201d Cherry said, \u201cand once I got information from my professors about the clinic, I jumped at the chance to help.\u201d\n\u201cIf you can help, help,\u201d she said.\nJovan Aquino, 20, a University of Maryland biochemistry student living in Kensington, Maryland, also volunteered his time.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been privileged being an American citizen,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to use that privilege to help others.\u201d\nRodriguez-Nanney\u2019s law firm has handled five DACA renewal cases this year, but only one since Trump\u2019s announcement.\nWhen immigrants are reapplying for DACA protections, Rodriguez-Nanney said, they have to first indicate that their application is a renewal, submit a copy of their existing work permit and submit their original DACA approval notice to the immigration services agency.\nImmigrants then need to fill out two applications: a DACA renewal application and a new work permit application. They must also submit a worksheet indicating why they need a new work permit. All of these forms must be submitted together to the immigration services agency.\nThe application process can take some time. There are 42 pages that immigrants have to read and fill out. But once the application is completed, it usually takes about an hour to prepare the application packet and three months for immigration services to process the application, said Rodriguez-Nanney.\nImmigrants also have to pay a $495 renewal fee.\nDespite the Oct. 5 deadline, \u201cit\u2019s still the same (DACA) renewal process,\u201d said Rodriguez-Nanney.",

    "content": "COLLEGE PARK, Maryland \u2014 While reports circulate that the Trump administration is closer to resolving questions left after last week\u2019s immigration announcement, Maryland\u2019s undocumented residents are uncertain of what comes next.\nIn conversations following the White House announcement, three of Maryland\u2019s \u201cdreamers,\u201d as they are often called, told Capital News Service they are worried about their future without the legal protections of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA.\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re undocumented, the only thing you can rely on is your community,\u201d said Nathaly Uribe Robledo, 22, of Glen Burnie, Maryland. \u201cFor a lot of us, this will be the first time that we will be living undocumented as adults with adult responsibilities.\u201d\nNathaly Uribe Robledo, 22, came to the United States from Chile, and has spent much of her time advocating for her community through work with CASA and other organizations. (Photo provided by Nathaly Uribe Robledo.)\nRobledo arrived with her mother from Chile 20 years ago on tourist visas, she told Capital News Service.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been here since I was 2 years old, and I have very little memory \u2013 if any \u2013 of Chile,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of my life and my memories, all of my special life events, have occurred here in the U.S.\u201d\n\u201cThe main reason my parents decided to come to the U.S. was the lack of opportunity in Chile,\u201d Robledo continued. \u201cThere was so much economic instability in Chile, and coming to the U.S. meant a better opportunity for a better life.\u201d\nDACA was created in 2012 under an executive order issued by President Barack Obama shielding young undocumented immigrants from deportation and granting them two-year renewable work permits.\nSince the program began, almost 800,000 people have been approved. To be eligible, immigrants had to be between the ages of 16 and 31 as of June 25, 2012. They also had to have lived in the United States since 2007, according to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).\nRobledo applied for her first permit in 2012 and again when the program was briefly expanded to three-year stays in 2014. She applied most recently in July.\nPresident Donald Trump on Sept. 5 gave Congress six months to find a legislative solution to address the program. New DACA applications will no longer be accepted but undocumented immigrants who are already covered can still apply for renewal, as long it is by Oct. 5.\n\u201cI can personally say that (with DACA) I finally felt like an average, normal American teenager,\u201d Robledo said.\nShe attended the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, until financial struggles forced her to withdraw in 2014. Robledo was pursuing a double major in biology and political science with dreams of becoming a representative in Congress. She now works at an insurance agency in Baltimore.\n\u201cI\u2019m very lucky, in a way, and privileged \u2013 which is kind of an oxymoron \u2013 to be in a situation where my friends are very supportive of me and my employer is very supportive,\u201d Robledo said.\nThe decision, while anticipated, felt \u201cdevastating\u201d for Robledo.\n\u201cI know my parents have made it 20 years undocumented, and I know that I can make it if I try, but it will be hard,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI\u2019m just so scared of the unknown because my whole life being undocumented so far has been while I was in school,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s already scary enough knowing that these are the years where you\u2019re supposed to set everything in motion for the rest of your life.\u201d\nA coalition of leaders across the country has signed a pledge supporting the DACA recipients. Among those are many Maryland politicians, including 12 state senators and four mayors.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a joint statement Wednesday that Trump \u201cagreed to enshrine the protections of DACA into law quickly, and to work out a package of border security, excluding the wall, that\u2019s acceptable to both sides.\u201d\nTrump disputed the account on Twitter, saying that \u201cno deal was made last night on DACA.\u201d\n\u201cWe cannot let the Trump Administration get away with tearing apart innocent families and wreaking havoc on our economy in Maryland,\u201d Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said in a Sept. 5 statement.\nAs of March, there were roughly 9,700 Marylanders enrolled in the DACA program, according to data from USCIS.\n\nIn Maryland, DACA-eligible dreamers are mainly found in three counties, based on 2016 data released by the Migration Policy Institute: Montgomery (roughly 8,000), Prince George\u2019s (6,000) and Baltimore (3,000).\nThe DACA-eligible population in Maryland accounts for about 9.5 percent of the state\u2019s total unauthorized population, said Jeanne Batalova, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.\nThe majority of DACA applicants in Maryland come from four countries: El Salvador (about 7,000 recipients), Mexico (5,000), Guatemala (4,000) and South Korea (2,000), per data from the institute.\n\u2018More than just Latinos\u2019\nCindy Kolade, 24, arrived in Baltimore shortly after her twelfth birthday with her mother from the Ivory Coast. Kolade said she will remain covered by DACA through February 2019.\nCindy Kolade, 24, originally from Abidjan, in the Ivory Coast, West Africa, came to Baltimore with her mother when she was 12 years old. (Photo provided to Capital News Service by Cindy Kolade.)\n\u201cDACA gave me a little bit of the American dream because I was able to provide for myself and provide for my family,\u201d Kolade said. \u201cWith DACA, I\u2019m able to help my mom with the bills.\u201d\nShe and her mother came straight to Maryland because \u201cit\u2019s the only place I have family.\u201d\n\u201cBaltimore shaped me into the person I am today,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m able to survive on my own and take care of myself.\u201d\nKolade works as a clinical lab assistant at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore. In 2014, she transferred to Towson University from Baltimore Community College. She is still in school, majoring in molecular biology.\nKolade is registered under Maryland\u2019s DREAM Act and also under DACA, and received her first DACA work permit in October 2012.\nIn 2012, Maryland passed its own DREAM Act to make in-state tuition accessible for its undocumented residents, provided they attended previous schooling in Maryland.\n\u201cWith DACA, I really thought I had it all for a minute,\u201d Kolade said. \u201cBut even though DACA doesn\u2019t give us the whole American dream\u2026, at least it gave us a chance to go to school, work, and be part of the American society.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s announcement has changed Kolade\u2019s thinking.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve given us something and you\u2019ve taken it away from us,\u201d she said. \u201cYou still have to worry about what happens next. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s going to stop in March or two or three years from now. It\u2019s really devastating because you don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to survive for yourself.\u201d\nKolade believes the administration\u2019s decision to rescind DACA is a sign that Trump doesn\u2019t understand that communities other than Latinos depend on the legal protections.\n\u201cAlthough (African populations) are a small minority, we still depend on DACA and still feel protected by it,\u201d Kolade said.\nBrian Frosh, Maryland\u2019s attorney general, announced Monday that Maryland will join Minnesota, California and Maine in a lawsuit against the decision to end DACA.\n\u201cThe callous and cavalier action taken by the Trump Administration will destroy the lives of many immigrants who were brought here as infants and toddlers, who love the United States of America, who pay taxes and abide by the law,\u201d Frosh said in a statement. \u201cEnding the program would constitute a $509.4 million loss to the state\u2019s annual GDP.\u201d\nStrength in Community\n\u201cWhen I graduated from community college in Maryland in 2011, there was no DACA,\u201d said Jose Aguiluz, 28, a registered nurse from Silver Spring, Maryland, who arrived from Honduras when he was 15.\nJose Aguiluz, 28, was one of several hundred people gathered outside the White House awaiting the administration\u2019s decision on Tuesday, Sept. 5th. (Photo by Helen Parshall/Capital News Service.)\n\u201cI had an associate\u2019s degree in nursing, but I was working as an electrician to pay my bills because it was the only job I could get,\u201d Aguiluz said. \u201cThen DACA came along and changed my life completely within the span of four months.\u201d\nUpon receiving his Social Security number and work permit, Aguiluz told Capital News Service, he found work in his field almost immediately.\n\u201cI went from being an electrician to having a job as an RN,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter being able to work legally, I went back to school and got my bachelor\u2019s degree in nursing from the University of Maryland University College.\u201d\nAguiluz had plans to continue his education, but is now at a loss because \u201cpretty much everything has been placed on hold.\u201d\n\u201cI was looking at my work permit this morning, and I have a stay here until November of next year when my permit expires,\u201d he said.\nIn 2012, Aguiluz worked with advocates to pass Maryland\u2019s DREAM Act.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really heartbreaking,\u201d he said. \u201cI brought dreamers to the table to register, and now all that information is in the hands of the government. The Department of Homeland Security knows the phone numbers and addresses of all of us.\u201d\nSince Trump\u2019s Sept. 5 decision, CASA, a local immigrants rights organization, is focused on helping dreamers get legal assistance before the final deadline.\n\u201cWe are holding several DACA renewal clinics,\u201d said Fernanda Durand, CASA communications manager. The clinics \u201chelp the DACA recipients renew their DACA applications.\u201d\nCASA will be holding three Maryland clinics before Oct. 5, said Durand: Sept. 16 and 30 in Langley Park and Sept. 23 in Baltimore.\nAguiluz is afraid of what so much rumor and confusion means for himself and other undocumented immigrants.\n\u201cWe are in a particularly unsafe position,\u201d Aguiluz said. \u201cThey can just go through my door and get me. It\u2019s very stressful.\u201d\nHowever, Aguiluz was smiling while talking to Capital News Service.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that this is a sad occasion,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom all the indications, we knew that this was going to happen. I\u2019m here because of my community, the community that I built when we started fighting for the DREAM Act in 2012.\u201d\n\u201cCommunity is what keeps us in this fight together.\u201d",

This shift reflects broader national trends of increasing immigration over the past 50 years, shaping America's multicultural identity.",
    "content": "SILVER SPRING, Maryland \u2013 Christina Getrich has lived in Maryland for most of her life and has witnessed the state\u2019s changing demographics over time.\nA large number of Salvadoran immigrants began settling in Montgomery County when she was younger, said Getrich, who lives in Silver Spring. Today, while Salvadorans are still the largest foreign-born population in the county, groups from countries such as India and Ethiopia also have sizable populations.\n\u201cWe all get so much from the presence of those people,\u201d said Getrich, a professor and anthropologist at the University of Maryland whose interests include immigration and citizenship. \u201cHere, we just have such a range of different people from different places. We\u2019re lucky in the D.C. area.\u201d\nAmerica\u2019s melting pot culture has seen an estimated 59 million immigrants over the past 50 years, according to the Pew Research Center, but this uptick in diversity took hundreds of years to take shape. \nPeople all over the world left their native countries for the United States after war, famine or persecution, or simply in search of a better future in what is perceived to be the land of opportunity.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that immigrants have made America what it is today,\u201d said Elizabeth Keyes, an assistant law professor and director of the Immigrants Rights Clinic at the University of Baltimore.\nIn 2013, 13 percent of the U.S. population \u2014 or more than 40 million people living in the U.S.  \u2014 were foreign-born, according to data from the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. And by 2055, no race or ethnicity will hold a majority, the data said.\nMaryland\u2019s foreign-born population has grown dramatically.  Of the 10 most diverse cities in America, three are located in the state: Gaithersburg, Germantown and Frederick, according to a 2016 WalletHub study.\nImmigrants favor Maryland for reasons such as its educational opportunities, said Jeanne Batalova, a senior analyst for the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank.\nU.S. News and World Report reported in April that Maryland high schools ranked the best in the nation for the third year in a row.\nOnce an ethnic community settles in a particular area, other members of that group tend to come to the same place later on, fueling a larger population of that demographic and contributing to greater migration in Maryland, Getrich added.\n\u201cCommunities establish themselves, and then it\u2019s a self-generating process,\u201d Getrich said. \u201cThroughout the area, we see the settlement of particular groups and areas in interesting ways.\u201d\nAmong metropolitan areas with more than 1 million residents, the Washington region ranked eighth in foreign-born residents, with about 22 percent of residents from other nations. Twenty-seven percent of people in the national capital region over age 5 spoke a language other than English at home, according to a report released by the U.S. Census Bureau as part of its 2011 American Community Survey.\nWhile 28 percent of the nation\u2019s legal immigrants come from Latin America, El Salvador is the most popular country of origin for legal immigrants in Maryland. Salvadorans \u2014 who make up 24.3 percent of Hispanics in Maryland \u2014 represent the largest part of the state\u2019s Hispanic community, followed by Mexicans and Puerto Ricans, according to the Department of Legislative Services.\nImmigrants and migrants have shaped multiple aspects of life in Maryland, such as the economy, education, medicine and politics. Historically, many of America\u2019s immigrants were blue-collar workers, but today\u2019s migrants in Maryland include workers of all skill levels, ranging from service workers to doctors, Keyes said.\nOccupations such as painting, construction and maintenance have the highest share of foreign-born workers in Maryland, with 63.4 percent of workers born outside the U.S., according to New American Economy, which aims to support changes to immigration policy, including securing the nation\u2019s borders and increasing enforcement to prevent illegal immigration, and create American jobs.\nSpecifically, Hispanic immigrants in Maryland \u2014 who live mostly in Montgomery and Prince George\u2019s Counties \u2014 paid $1.6 billion in taxes, and the state\u2019s median household income for Hispanics is the highest in the nation, the DLS reported.\nSixty-two percent of the state\u2019s maids and household workers, and 55.4 percent of medical and life scientists in Maryland, are foreign-born, according to NAE.\nBut with President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, Getrich said she is \u201cvery worried\u201d about the future of migrant communities in the United States and how they may be affected by national policies.\n\u201cWe know that migration is a phenomenon that is present in our world, so to me, what would be better is investing in immigrant communities and families and children to go onto make even more contributions to society,\u201d she said.\nTrump, however, has pursued policies that have alarmed immigrant communities and organizations advocating for immigrants.\nIn January, the president ordered a travel ban barring immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. \n\u201cThis is not about religion \u2013 this is about terror and keeping our country safe,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cThere are over 40 different countries worldwide that are majority Muslim that are not affected by this order.\u201d\nAfter various court challenges, the Supreme Court on Tuesday allowed most of the ban to remain in effect temporarily. The court next month will hear arguments over the constitutionality of the scope of the ban. \nThe president has proposed a new border wall with Mexico but appears to have backed off on pressing Congress for action now. Trump also has promoted a \u201cget tough\u201d policy on those not in the country legally and his administration has rescinded legal protections for children of undocumented immigrants put in place by an executive order by President Barack Obama. Instead, the president appears to support congressional efforts to make those protections permanent by passing a new law.    \nThe tone of the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies unsettles some observers. \n\u201cI grew up thinking that a strength of the United States was the way in which we welcome people from different cultures,\u201d said Julie Greene, a history professor at the University of Maryland and a historian of subjects including U.S. labor and immigration. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to imagine this country without the incredible role played by immigrants.\u201d\n\u201cThe current president does not believe that immigration has been such a positive force,\u201d Batalova said. \u201cHe thinks America is just for Americans. Those included in that (are) just a slice of American society.\u201d\nSome Maryland policymakers and local organizations also have responded to Trump\u2019s proposals with efforts to protect members of the immigrant community. Legislators moved to pass the Maryland Trust Act, which would bar police from complying with federal immigration enforcement efforts. \nWhile the bill did not pass the Maryland General Assembly, cities such as Takoma Park and Hyattsville have adopted official \u201csanctuary city\u201d status, and others have enacted similar practices, one example of \u201cfederal policies and efforts being mitigated by policies adopted by states,\u201d Batalova said.\nOrganizations such as CASA, the Baltimore Resettlement Center and the Maryland Office for Refugees and Asylees have offered resources to members of the migrant community settled in Maryland.\n\u201cThere\u2019s things we can do for people,\u201d Keyes said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of small things that can be done, too, and people are doing them.\u201d",

    "content": "By CONNER HOYT, ANGELA JACOB, J.F. MEILS, JOHNNY MOSEMAN, HELEN PARSHALL, ASHLEY CLARKE and CHANGEZ ALI\nCapital News Service\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Maryland\u2019s congressional Democrats and various immigrant rights groups condemned the Trump administration\u2019s decision Tuesday to rescind an order protecting immigrant children who were brought to the United States illegally. \nLawmakers said removing protections for such immigrants would disrupt families and be cruel to those who were not to blame for their illegal status. \nAs Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the decision only blocks away, a crowd of a couple hundred protesters backing the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program assembled at LaFayette Park and yelled \u201cShame!\u201d in the direction of the White House while beating drums.\nHouse Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Mechanicsville, said the announcement signaled a \u201cdark day in our nation\u2019s history\u201d and implored Congress to pass legislation to make DACA permanent sometime this month.  \n\u201cI know DACA kids, I\u2019ve actually volunteered to do applications for them,\u201d said Priscilla Labovitz, a Takoma Park, Maryland, resident. \u201cI was an immigration lawyer, but I retired, so I know them as human beings, as nice kids, not in some lumped up way of \u2018illegals\u2019 because nobody is illegal.\u201d\nRev. Jennifer Butler, the CEO of Faith and Public Life, a network of 40,000 religious leaders across the country, said the decision to revoke DACA goes against the major principles she believes in as a Christian.\n\u201cIt\u2019s morally despicable. I stood out there today with young people who are mourning, who are weeping,\u201d Butler said. \n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep fighting,\u201d she added. \u201cClergy are planning even now to take these folks into their houses and into their sanctuaries. We don\u2019t believe in this, and we are going to oppose it every step of the way.\u201d\nRep. Andy Harris, R-Cockeysville, was the lone congressional voice from Maryland who came out in favor of the DACA wind-down. \u201cI strongly support President (Donald) Trump\u2019s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThe Obama-era policy is a gross overreach of executive power and undermined the authority of the legislative branch. President Trump is returning that power to Congress.\u201d\nSen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, had the opposite reaction. \u201cClearly written with little thought of the human consequences, this latest action by the Trump Administration will harm our economic and national security,\u201d Cardin said. \u201cIt will break families and drive many underground, out of work and into poverty.\u201d\nMaryland\u2019s other Democratic senator, Chris Van Hollen, warned of the economic impact of repealing DACA. \n\u201cOver its five-year history, DACA has helped nearly 800,000 young people pursue higher education and grow our economy,\u201d Van Hollen said in a statement. \u201cEnding this program will cost our economy over $460.3 billion over ten years and displace over 685,000 workers vital to businesses in Maryland and across the nation.\u201d\nRoughly 9,000 Marylanders are beneficiaries of DACA, and according to Sessions\u2019 announcement, they will remain so for the next six months, as the administration plans to use an interim period to usher out the order\u2019s recipients. \nHowever, any DACA requests filed after Tuesday will be rejected, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Filings for renewal for current recipients will be accepted until Oct. 5. \nSessions announced the administration\u2019s decision to a roomful of reporters but took no questions. Trump issued a statement following the announcement.\nEnding the DACA program would leave roughly 800,000 illegal immigrants subject to deportation.  \nA 2012 executive order by President Obama allowed people who came to the United States as children to apply for deferred action for two years at a time. Once the deferred action expired, recipients could apply for renewal.\nRecipients had to have been at least 15 and under 31 as of June 15, 2012. An applicant convicted of a felony or at least three misdemeanors was ineligible. \nTrump has advocated for DACA\u2019s end since his presidential campaign and, after the seeming inevitability of its termination came to a head this weekend, urged Congress via Twitter to \u201cget ready to do (its) job.\u201d \n\u201cEnforcing the law saves lives, protects communities and taxpayers and prevents human suffering,\u201d said Sessions, who three times referred to DACA recipients as \u201cillegal aliens.\u201d \n\u201cFailure to enforce the laws in the past has put our nation at risk of crime, violence and terrorism,\u201d the attorney general said.\nBut a wide array organizations and individuals across the political spectrum, from Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain and the United States Chamber of Commerce to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and California Gov. Jerry Brown, decried the administration\u2019s move. Some pledged court challenges.\nIn Lafayette Park across from the White House, protesters said they were dismayed at what felt like a betrayal.\n\u201cI served in the United States military, and this is not the type of freedom I served for,\u201d said Jaime Contreras, a vice president at 32BJ SEIU, the Washington D.C., Maryland and Virginia affiliate of the Service Employees International Union, told Capital News Service. \n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense economically or socially in any form.\u201d \nAdditional protesters marched along Pennsylvania Avenue, sitting down and blocking traffic just outside the Trump International Hotel. \nSheridan Aguirre, a DACA beneficiary, called the decision to strike down the executive order \u201ccruel.\u201d \n\u201cWe have had five years now being able to live authentically as ourselves, and it\u2019s been a cornerstone of safety for our immediate families,\u201d he said in an interview with CNS. \u201cWe need to heal, we need to come together to talk about what\u2019s happening, and in the long term be able to fight for a permanent solution.\u201d\nAguirre is a 23-year-old undocumented immigrant from Austin, Texas, who said his life\u2019s direction was uncertain before DACA. He graduated high school in Texas in June of 2012, days before DACA was announced.\nAfter DACA was implemented, Aguirre, then 19, became the first person in his family to get a driver\u2019s license.\nBobbie Monahan came into the city from Baltimore with other members of her Catholic parish, St. Gabriel, Woodlawn, to support the work of CASA.\n\u201cIt is a great injustice, and my faith tells me to be here,\u201d said Monahan. \u201cIf the heads of my church aren\u2019t moving fast enough, then we\u2019ll get out there and show them.\u201d \nHoyer said he would like to see DACA passed and take effect permanently. \n\u201cWe will see whether or not the statements of both sympathy and support for Dreamers (by Republicans) are in fact carried out legislatively or whether or not the most strident voices within the Republican Party fomenting anger and ire directing (sic) at these young people are followed,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully they will not be.\u201d\nHoyer would not commit to the idea of using would-be Democratic votes for upcoming bills on Hurricane Harvey relief, the debt ceiling, or a continuing budget resolution as leverage to force passage of DACA legislation. \nIn the meantime, Hoyer believes that DACA would pass right now if it was introduced in the House. \n\u201cI frankly think the votes are there,\u201d he said. \u2018Will there be controversy? There will because there are some people who don\u2019t want to see anybody admitted to the U.S. and particularly anybody who came here unauthorized.\u201d\nIn 2015, Hoyer signed an amicus brief along with 180 other House members including Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Reps. John Sarbanes, D-Towson, Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Timonium, John Delaney, D-Potomac, and Elijah Cummings, D-Baltimore, supporting Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) and DACA.\n\u201cPresident Trump is breaking his promise to hundreds of thousands of DREAMers who were brought here as children \u2013 through no fault of their own \u2013 and today know only America as their home,\u201d Cummings said in a statement. \u201cOur children are the living messages we send to a future we will never see and eliminating DACA sends a terrible message.\u201d",

    "content": "OCEAN CITY, Maryland\u2013As the summer tourism season comes to a close in Ocean City, Maryland, many businesses fear they may soon lose much of their seasonal workforce if the Trump administration cancels the J-1 visa program.\nThe White House may be considering reducing the J-1 visa exchange visitor program, which brings in more than 100,000 students from foreign countries to the U.S. each summer, often to work in tourist destinations like Ocean City, according to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal.\nWhile the J-1 program\u2019s future is still up in the air, the Justice Department announced Tuesday morning that it is ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA, which was created under the Obama Administration in 2012, and has shielded nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation.\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions said that Congress will have six months to replace the policy with legislation.\nPresident Trump is considering reducing the J-1 program as part of his \u201cBuy American and Hire American\u201d executive order he issued in April, which calls for a review of U.S. immigration rules to make sure that the interests of American workers are protected, according to the Wall Street Journal report. \n\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to function and would probably have to shut down at least half of the hotel,\u201d if the J-1 program is cut, said Greg Dominguez, front office manager at the Grand Hotel and Spa. The hotel employs about 100 J-1 students each summer.\nThe hotel would struggle, Dominguez said, because the J-1 students take on so many different roles. The students are front office clerks, housekeepers, maintenance workers, servers and cooks. \nJ-1 visa holders make up a large portion of the nearly 12,000 seasonal positions needed each summer in Maryland\u2019s largest resort town.\n\u201cHere at Ocean City, we typically see about 4,000 workers that come over,\u201d said Melanie Pursel, executive director of the Greater Ocean City Maryland Chamber of Commerce. \u201cThey come to Ocean City usually around May or June and work for about three months.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPursel said it\u2019s a misperception that the J-1 program is taking American jobs. \u201cThese students are coming here to work, to experience the U.S. and then go back to their home countries. They\u2019re not taking American jobs.\u201d\nWhether the J-1 program will share the same fate as DACA is still up in the air, one work exchange advocacy group said Tuesday. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any more information yet,\u201d said Ranit Schmelzer, communications consultant for the Alliance for International Exchange.\nOcean City struggles to hire enough Americans each year, area business owners told the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service. \nMany young Americans simply don\u2019t want to work for only three months, said Brooks Trimper, operations manager at Trimper\u2019s Rides, an amusement park on the boardwalk that employs about 130 J-1 students each summer.\nBrooks Trimper in Ocean City, Md., on Sunday, September 3, 2017. Trimper is worried that if the J-1 program is reduced, he will not have enough employees to operate in the summer. (Chris Miller/Capital News Service)\n\u201cI\u2019m offering great, fun jobs for three months and I can\u2019t really get a lot of people that want to take those jobs.\u201d \nHe said that most Americans are searching for year-round work.\nFor others, simply commuting to Ocean City each day to work can be a problem. Young kids in nearby cities might want to work but lack transportation, Jones said.\nLocal business owners agree that without the international students, Ocean City would struggle to operate.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure we will survive if the J-1 visa program is gone,\u201d said Trimper. Trimper\u2019s employees have to be at least 18 to operate the rides, so that excludes many high school students; meanwhile many U.S. college students go back to school in mid-August.\nBut it\u2019s not just the Ocean City businesses that would suffer.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more than just a work program,\u201d said Pursel, \u201cit\u2019s really a cultural exchange program and these students really give a lot to the guest experience as well.\u201d She said that the guests enjoy learning from the students and hearing about their home countries.\nThe J-1 students also learn what it\u2019s like to live and work in America.\nAna Pirnea, 24, from Romania, works as a ride operator at Trimper\u2019s and this is her second year as a J-1 student. She worked in Myrtle Beach, S.C., last summer. She said that the students are not mainly here for the money. \u201cThey are here just to feel the American experience,\u201d she said and \u201cto have fun.\u201d\n\u201cEurope is just Europe.

There are about 300 Irish students in Ocean City, said Rick Fairbend, who, along with his wife, Pat, opened the center earlier this year. The center\u2019s Facebook page says that \u201cIf you need bedding, towels, pots and pans, tea pots plus other items stop in. Or if you just need a shoulder to lean on we are here for you.\u201d\nUltimately, the students return to their home countries with fond memories and stories. \u201cThey give America good press,\u201d said Trimper. \u201cWe need that right now.\u201d",

It takes just a few minutes for the price of human labor to decline \u2013 often below the state\u2019s minimum wage \u2013 as men desperate for work underbid each other.\nOn a recent weekday, eight trucks pulled in over a two-hour period and separately negotiated with about 10 workers at a time. The bidding started at $12 an hour. But because there were more laborers than employers, the price frequently fell to as little as $5 per hour, significantly lower than the state\u2019s mandated $8.75 minimum hourly wage and Prince George\u2019s County\u2019s minimum wage of $10.75 an hour. Although several workers cut deals at that low rate, Jose, a construction worker who moved to the U.S. from Guatemala 21 years ago, held out for higher pay \u2013 a decision that cost him a job at the time.\nEven though Jose sometimes works for less than the $16 an hour he thinks he should be earning, he won\u2019t bid himself down as low as the other workers. Day laborers make so little, he said, that they \u201chave to work sometimes day and sometimes day and nights.\u201d (Capital News Service is withholding the last names of day workers to protect them from possible retaliatory actions from employers.)\nScenes such as this have become a common part of the American informal job market and are especially prevalent in heavily immigrant areas such as Langley Park, a small community in Prince George\u2019s County that is home to many families that have come to the U.S. from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and other countries in Central America and Africa.\nImmigrant day workers say these informal markets serve a good purpose by allowing them to find work easily and without signing paperwork or governmental oversight. But worker advocates argue that these markets actually work against the long-term interest of immigrants by pulling wages down so low that families struggle to break out of poverty. The average annual income for day laborers in Langley Park, many of whom are in the U.S. illegally, is between $10,000 and $15,000, according to CASA de Maryland, the largest Latino and immigrant advocacy organization in the Washington, D.C. area.\nMoreover, some economists believe these trends have trickled down to the broader job market and could partly explain why wages for some low-skilled workers \u2013 both native-born and immigrants \u2013 have remained stuck at the same level for decades and in some cases have fallen.\n\u201cThe theory says that increased supply [of workers] should lower wages,\u201d said Nicholas Montgomery, a labor economist at the University of Maryland. Montgomery says that while native-born Americans might frown at the idea of working for less than minimum wage, many immigrants calculate their earnings differently. \u201cI do believe these workers are thinking, \u2018What is the way that I can make the most amount of money?\u2019 And that\u2019s not necessarily holding out for a higher wage. And I would rather bid myself down to $8 an hour, and have an 80 percent chance of getting a job, than having a 10 percent chance at $15 an hour.\u201d\nBetween March 2006 and March 2016, average weekly wages adjusted for inflation for all U.S. production workers rose 8.2 percent to $309.68, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That category includes workers in construction, manufacturing and service jobs and those who are not primarily employed to supervise others. But average weekly wages for workers in some industries haven\u2019t kept pace and in some cases have declined.\nFor example, average weekly wages for workers in the janitorial services industry declined 1.8 percent from March 2006 to March 2016 to $144.56; wages for employees in the house painting industry declined 3.3 percent to $307.46 and average wages for workers in the house and office furniture moving industry were down 11.5 percent to $235.76. Average weekly wages for workers in landscaping services rose 6.2 percent, but remained relatively low at just $252.85 in March 2016.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been tough\u201d to convince workers not to underbid their labor, says Delia Aguilar, the senior manager of workforce development for CASA de Maryland. She says that workers believe that jobs are more plentiful in the informal markets, \u201cbut that doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re getting fair payment.\u201d\nSince 1985, CASA has tried to push back against falling wages by establishing so-called \u201cwelcome\u201d centers where employers and potential employees can meet and CASA mediators will help negotiate wages and working conditions. CASA\u2019s welcome center in Langley Park opened in 2008 and handles between 20 and 40 workers daily.\nCASA sets a wage floor of $10 per hour, though Aguilar said employers often pay at least $12 an hour. Higher-skilled workers earn between $15 and $20 per hour, a sharp increase from the federal minimum wage of $7.25 and Maryland\u2019s $8.75 hourly minimum wage. The state\u2019s hourly wage is set to increase to $9.25 in July.\nIn return for paying higher wages, contractors that hire via CASA take on workers who have received job and safety training. CASA offers classes on building maintenance, drywall, heating and cooling and other occupational skills, and instructs workers on professional dress and behavior.\nStill, some employers \u201care going to try to save money, and they see it as a business opportunity to do that,\u201d Aguilar said of contractors who hire non-CASA workers for cheaper wages. \u201cSome employers are conscious, they understand, what we have over here is a little bit different. They pay a little bit more, but they understand that the process is more viable.\u201d\nCASA operates with a first-in, first-out system: When workers arrive, as early as 6 a.m., they sign in and wait for the first employer to show up with work. The second worker to arrive then moves up a slot, and so on, with the rotation carrying over to the next day. When employers pick up laborers, they sign documentation agreeing to what CASA\u2019s staff refers to as a \u201cliving wage.\u201d If employers don\u2019t pay, CASA\u2019s legal services team comes knocking.\nFelix, an immigrant from Cameroon in Central Africa, appreciates CASA\u2019s tactics. \u201cCASA is looking out for everybody, not for a particular person,\u201d said Felix, who has been finding jobs through the welcome center for the past three years. He said he rarely participates in the informal markets because he isn\u2019t willing to work for less than $10 per hour and he doesn\u2019t like the way workers undermine each other. \u201cEverybody up there is everybody for themselves.\u201d \nAt least as many workers choose to look for work outside of CASA, though. For those laborers, it\u2019s better to work for less pay than to not work at all, a risk with CASA\u2019s one-in one-out system. With no way to collectively enforce CASA\u2019s higher pay, wages end up dropping for all workers, according to Montgomery.\n\u201cThere\u2019s only going to be so many people who are willing to hire people at $15 an hour,\u201d Montgomery said. \u201cAnd however many people that is, it is fewer than the number of people who are willing to hire people for $10 an hour. If you underbid, that increases your probability of getting a job.\u201d\nWorkers who operate outside of CASA underbid themselves because they think in terms of accrued wages, not hourly, Montgomery and Aguilar agree. Although CASA workers earn more hourly, the probability of not getting work in a given day is higher. Non-CASA laborers, conversely, might work more often but make less money hourly.\nCASA encourages employers to request workers through an online form and telephone calls so they don\u2019t have to physically go to center and be \u201charassed\u201d by outside workers, Aguilar said. Langley Park is the only of CASA\u2019s five welcome centers with this issue because it is located in a strip mall\u2019s basement. It is easy for outside workers to intercept employers on their way to CASA, offering to work for less than those waiting downstairs, she said.\n\u201cWe understand at the same time, [non-CASA laborers] are in need,\u201d Aguilar said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to do as much as they can to be able to make that money that they need to support their families. At the same time, they are changing the environment in the area.\u201d",

    "summary": "Victor, an immigrant worker from Guatemala, frequently faces non-payment or underpayment by employers in the U.S., highlighting the widespread issue of wage theft affecting vulnerable immigrant workers. This problem is exacerbated by their limited legal protection and language barriers, with estimates suggesting that workers lose billions annually due to such practices.",
    "content": "By Alyson Kay\nLANGLEY PARK, Maryland \u2014 Victor came to the U.S. 15 years ago looking for steady work. In many ways, the U.S. has met his expectations and he gets hired most days to do day labor for construction companies or commercial contractors. But one thing he may not have expected is that some employers wouldn\u2019t pay him what they promised.\nVictor, an immigrant from Guatemala, says he\u2019s cheated on as many as 20 percent of the jobs he takes. \u201cSometimes it looks like a big contractor and then at the end of the day, they say, \u2018I\u2019ll call you in a week,\u201d to set up a payment arrangement. Frequently, he says, the call never comes. (Capital News Service is withholding Victor\u2019s last name to protect him from possible retaliatory actions by employers.)\nWage theft is a big and growing problem in the U.S. and affects a wide variety of mostly low-wage workers. It\u2019s an especially big issue in immigrant communities, where workers are often hired off the books and are vulnerable due to their legal status and limited proficiency in English.\nIn fact, attorneys who work with immigrants say that wage theft is one of the most common reasons why Latin American and other non-native workers seek legal services.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that day laborers are ripped off of millions of dollars of wages each year throughout the United States,\u201d says Steve Smitson, an immigration attorney in Ellicott City at Smitson Law LLC. \u201cDay laborers are the most vulnerable workers because often they\u2019re least equipped to defend their rights and they\u2019re seen as easy targets for unscrupulous employers.\u201d\nAs cities and states across the U.S. move to increase the minimum wage, the number of employers violating the rules grows. According to the Economic Policy Institute, workers in the U.S. lose between $8.6 billion and $13.8 billion a year because they are paid below their state\u2019s minimum wage. That estimate\u2013 which includes all workers, native-born and immigrants\u2013was extrapolated based on a study prepared for the U.S. Department of Labor of minimum wage violations in 2011 in New York and California, two states with relatively high minimum wage requirements. The study also found that non-citizens were 1.6 to 3.1 times more likely to be affected by minimum wage violations, according to the EPI.\nKim Bobo, the executive director of the Virginia Interfaith Center for Public Policy, said the numbers in the Labor Department study likely understate wage theft because they only included incidents that were reported and many immigrant workers don\u2019t report their grievances to the government. The data may also exclude incidents when workers aren\u2019t paid at all or what was promised, even if the amount was above minimum wage.\n\u201cIf you are feeling vulnerable about getting or keeping a job, you will tend not to complain even when you know your employer is breaking the law,\u201d said Bobo, the author of the 2011 book, \u201cWage Theft in America.\u201d Without complaints, she said, \u201cmost enforcement agencies don\u2019t investigate and wage theft continues.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not just businesses doing the cheating. CASA de Maryland, the largest Latino and immigrant advocacy organization in the Washington area, says homeowners who hire workers for landscaping and furniture moving jobs sometimes short-change workers, too. CASA legal services once spent two months trying to force a local homeowner to pay $60 to two workers who spent several hours laying mulch on her property. The homeowner promised to pay each worker $60, but after the work was completed, she paid the men half the agreed upon amount. After CASA threatened legal action, the homeowner finally paid up.\nEconomists say that wage theft drives poor families deeper into poverty, prompting them to apply for federal subsidies such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and free school breakfast and lunch for children. That hurts taxpayers to the benefit of employers that skirt the laws.\nMaryland is especially ripe for such abuses, says attorney Smitson, due to the large amount of construction taking place in the state. While wage theft occurs in many industries, construction contractors and subcontractors in particular use day laborers frequently and have more complaints against them.\nVictor says employers find lots of ways to cheat. In December 2016, he was hired for a framing job that lasted three days. The employer agreed to pay him $300 for the work. At the end of the three days, the employer paid Victor with a check. But when he tried to cash the check, the bank said it wasn\u2019t negotiable. \u201cWhen I go back and catch him to get my money, he said, \u2018No! I don\u2019t got money right now,\u2019\u201d said Victor. He didn\u2019t want to cause problems or bring attention to himself, and gave up trying to collect.\nAttorneys at the Community Legal Services of Prince George\u2019s County say such stories have become common. Valerie Adeyeye, a worker\u2019s rights lawyer at the center, says wage theft cases are the most frequent that the center sees.\nWhen a client comes to the worker\u2019s rights clinic, Ms. Adeyeye contacts the employer and tries to arrange a settlement. \u201cWe can write demand letters on their behalf,\u201d said Adeyeye. \u201cWe can help them file a complaint.\u201d Rarely do the cases go to court.\nShe also helps workers file complaints with the Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation or the D.C Office of Employment.\nWhile stricter enforcement by the government could reduce minimum wage violations for most American workers, there is little that can be done to help undocumented immigrants. Bobo said while there is a need for more enforcement, employer groups and trade associations can play a part in the solution by setting higher standards for their business members. Consumers can also help, especially when people buy a contracted service.\n\u201cThe consuming public needs to ask questions,\u201d Bobo said. \u201cWhen we hire somebody we need to ask \u2018Are you paying your workers fairly? Do you pay them as employees? Do you pay them as independent contractors?\u2019 There are things that as consumers both as individual consumers, but if we\u2019re purchasing contracted services to our companies or to our congregations, we can be ethical consumers as well and ask questions.\u201d",
