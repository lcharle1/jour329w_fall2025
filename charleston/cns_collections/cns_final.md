# Describe important changes to the prompt/data and the differences they made in the result. How good is the final version of the beat book? What does it lack?

Our last discussion inspired me to think of the Beat Book as a learning tool. So the new versions I tested look into the dfferent teaching styles or guides. 


## Trial 1 - Training Manual
There are ups and downs with the first trial. I am happy with the quality of the responses and how indepth they are and the structure. I am concerned for a section or two and the word choice. I know I wanted a training manual style but the word choice for some section titles feel a little juvenile.

Trial 1 is inspired by a training manual. I added  'structured cirriculum progression' to the prompt hoping for that teaching style with background informaiton, and important and relevant details to teach the journalist what they need to know. I also emphasized adding the date of publication for articles used as an example. 

Looking through this prototype, I realize the objective secton is not necessary if you have the 'What You Need to Know First'. 

My first concern is 'The Current Moment' section. It says the most recent story is May 19, 2025, which isn't true. The latest story regarding immigration was a week a ago. But the story it references is real. I do not see a lot of stories after May of this year.

I mentioned in class having a key or legend for names and acronyms that require a little more explanation, especially for someone new to the area. It provided that within immigration subtopcs (deportation and legal status). 

I appreciate how extensive the analysis on the subtopics are. For deportation it explains how it can be wrongful, rapid, and a consequence of misinformation. Looking into these responses you can tell it reflects the CNS's coverage of these stories. Most of the stories include the devastating impact of the immigration crackdown. I know one story included someone being quoted for how the 287 agreement makes them feel safer. Since comments like that are not popular I can see how the LLM overlooked this perspective of deportation.

'Core Reading' and 'Key concepts to Master' are interesting word choices but I am interested in keeping - just change the name of it. Immediately knowing what I need to read to get more background on whats already been covered saves time and could inspire new questions/story angles.

The 'questions to answer' should be renamed to 'follow-up questions' or something like that. 

The module and schedule format it has later, resembling a syllabus, should be changed. The week timeline unnecessary and I wonder if that was created because of the mention of timelines in the prompt. 

Each module seems like a subtopic of immigration and it points the journalist in the right direction, with some background or further anaylsis of the topic. 

For underreported stories it is inconsistent the amount of information or suggestion is provided. Some topics of a paragraph explaining "why now", "why underreported", "where to report", "interview suggestions", etc. It is not the same for each underreported angle.

I very much appreciate the extra help this prototype gives when it comes to covering immigration. Part 6: How to Report Immigration Stories is very helpful especially if the journalist has no prior experience covering these type of stories. Also, if the journalist does not have a lot of experience or knowledge with immigration to begin with, these types of sections are very helpful. It's one thing to hear about these things on the news. It feels far away almost, but living close, witnessing, or even having those same concern or understanding as your interviewee is different. The style and angle of the story can be different. 

Part 7 is much appreciated. I think requesting a training manual format helps with some categories naturally being included, like the glossary and indepth breakdown of the different topics.

Part 8 puzzled me because why does it stop at May 2025?

This prototype is long and extensive but I think is very valuable and a good example of what a Beat Book should include and how it should be formatted.


## Trial 2 - Standard Operation Manual
- I think this is a good shorter example. It does a great job but it being shorter looses the extensiveness that the first trial has. I do think length is important here but overall the Beat Book will save time. So some chapers in the book will be loger than others is ok. It determines really on how much the journalist needs to know. 

I think changing the format to standard operation manual influenced it's lenth. The cirriculum structure is also gone but the detail and explanation is. Speaking of explanation, I felt the first trial might have coddled the journalist a little so I added this sentence: "Detail is necessary but overexplanation is not". This could explain why it is shorter.

- I noticed a shift in organization depending on the format I request. Here the key institutions and players are at the beginning after the introduction.
- Still a situation of no stories after May 2025.
- I appreciate the structure of the different subtopics. It explains the story, includes the link, lists and explains any relevant players and institutions, includes caveats - if any - , suggested future coverage, and key reporting angles. But these elements of this part of the manual are not consistent for each story listed. 
- There is an unresolved case section. Usually this is something that is mentioned if the article is mentioned, but here it is mentioned on its own. 
- There are two Key institution and players section. One in the beginning and one at the bottom. They are different though, these are specific names. 
- Including different ways to improve the writing is appreciated. Section "How to Structure Your Stories" and "Important Context for Your Coverage" will help make sure the journalist completes the stories correctly and with ethical consideration.

## Trial 3
- With trial 3, I wanted to see the quality of the response if we shortened the prompt. This was out of curiousity. Each sentence is like a command
- This version is shorter but still helpful. It does not go into the specific details prior versions have. The separate section of listing people and institution is not there but it is done a few times in paragraphs where it is relevant. The sections of information we've seen before - i.e., ethical consideration, underreported, suggested resources to use, explanation of people and institutions, etc. - but it is formatted differently. Some no longer have their own extensive section, its listed whereever it is relevant, and then moves on to the next example. This tells me that the prompt for this Beat Book will not be a short one and the examples and specification is necessary for the prompt too. 

## Trial 4 
- This version is not too different from trial two. It contains more details on resource to use and has a separate section for people and institutions, in comparison to trial 3. It even suggested geographic focus areas and sources to contact. 
- I added 'menu writing style' because I wanted to use a different writing style that fit the criterias we needed. Concise with important information. I was also simply curious what mentioning a writing style like that would include. I was worried it would write differently, using food analogy. Like how trial 1 wrote like it was a syllabus because I included 'structured cirriculum progression'. Overall, this is not a bad outcome, but 'menu writing style' is no different than prior suggested writing formats. 


Overall I would rank the trials as such based on how much I like the results, despite any concerns we need to work on:
- trial 1
- trial 2 
- trial 3
- trial 4
