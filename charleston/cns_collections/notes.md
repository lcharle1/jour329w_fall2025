Immigration, 77 stories

**Required Fields (all beats should have these):**
- **people**: Array of key people mentioned (names only)
- **geographic_focus**: Primary location (county, city, region, or "statewide")
- **key_institutions**: Organizations, agencies, companies involved
- **immigration_status**: legal immigrants, not legal immigrants, illegal immigrants, not mentioned 

# review 
- All of my LLMS failed. 
- I realized I typed "Immigration status" and not "immigration_status". I will fix the formatting to match the other metadatas
