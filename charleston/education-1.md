# Education Beat Book: A Guide for Early-Career Journalists

## Introduction

Education in Maryland is experiencing a moment of intense transformation and tension. The state has committed to a sweeping, multi-billion dollar reform called the Blueprint for Maryland's Future, but its implementation is struggling with funding shortages, teacher recruitment challenges, and a surge in chronic student absenteeism. Meanwhile, local school boards have become politically charged battlegrounds over culture war issues like transgender student policies and book collections. For a journalist covering education in Maryland, understanding these competing narratives—the grand ambitions of reform versus the daily chaos of implementation—is essential.

The state's education beat is dominated by a single policy framework, the Blueprint, which has spawned hundreds of stories. But underneath all that coverage are deeper structural problems: the state is losing childcare capacity at an alarming rate, schools are adopting new disciplinary approaches that provoke criticism from conservative groups, and mental health crises among students are straining school resources. These stories are interconnected. A journalist who understands the Blueprint won't be equipped to cover education well without also understanding chronic absenteeism, the teacher shortage, and the child care crisis that makes it harder for families to keep kids in school.

## The Big Story: Maryland's Blueprint for Education

The [Blueprint for Maryland's Future](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/03/04/behind-the-blueprint-a-local-news-network-project-on-marylands-landmark-education-reform/) is the foundational policy you need to understand. Passed in 2021 and implemented beginning in the 2024-2025 school year, it's a $30+ billion, 10-year commitment to remake virtually every public school in Maryland. Think of it as the state's bet that money and systemic reform can fix what pandemic learning loss, teacher burnout, and generational underinvestment have broken.

The Blueprint operates on five pillars:

**Early Childhood Education** expands full-day, government-paid pre-K to all 3- and 4-year-olds from families at or below 300% of federal poverty level. Wealthier families pay on a sliding scale. The goal: make pre-K available to all 4-year-olds by 2025-26. This is contentious because the state is relying on private child care providers to participate, and many are refusing.

**High Quality and Diverse Teachers and Leaders** seeks to attract and retain teachers through higher pay (minimum $60,000 by 2026 in some counties), additional training, and support for National Board Certification. It also targets workforce diversity, recognizing that Black teachers have "exceptionally large impacts" on student outcomes.

**College and Career Readiness** aims to prepare all students for college or careers by the end of 10th grade through curriculum redesign and expanded dual enrollment and technical education.

**Increased Resources** raises per-pupil state funding from $8,642 to $12,365 by 2032-33. But this also places funding burdens on local school districts.

**Governance and Accountability** created the Accountability and Implementation Board, a seven-member oversight body that monitors 92 data measures and can withhold funding from districts failing to implement initiatives.

### The Funding Crisis

Here's the problem: the Blueprint's funding mechanism is breaking down. Governor Wes Moore faces a state budget crisis, and in early 2025, he proposed cutting Blueprint funding from $110 million to $40 million. This sent shockwaves through the state. As reported in February 2025, [Moore's cuts to the Blueprint plan faced major pushback](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/02/21/moores-blueprint-cuts-face-major-pushback/) from students, parents, and educators. The funding was eventually restored—though not to full levels—after advocacy pressure. This is a live, unresolved story. Watch for whether the funding sticks or becomes a permanent point of contention.

The deeper financial tension is this: counties are struggling to afford their share. In spring 2024, county officials, particularly Baltimore and Harford County leaders, called the Blueprint ["unrealistic" and "unfunded."](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/05/07/unrealistic-and-unfunded-marylands-blueprint-for-education-has-counties-concerned/) School administrators across the state have warned that without clear guidance, extended deadlines, and stable funding, implementation will fail. The Accountability and Implementation Board itself has had to repeatedly extend deadlines because districts didn't have information in time to meet them.

**Story idea:** Track one school district's Blueprint implementation over a full school year. Compare what was promised to what actually happened. Are class sizes shrinking? Are new teachers being hired? Is pre-K expanding? Follow the money.

### Pre-K Expansion Resistance

One of the Blueprint's signature failures so far is pre-K expansion. The state is relying on private child care providers to open new pre-K slots, but nearly 40% of surveyed providers have declined to participate. They cite staffing requirements, regulatory burden, and fears of losing revenue once the state offers free pre-K.

[Maryland's pre-K expansion plan has proved unpopular with child care providers,](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/07/09/the-state-is-counting-on-child-care-providers-to-offer-pre-k-but-many-are-uninterested/) according to July 2024 reporting. Private providers worry they'll become "guinea pigs" in a new program they don't trust. Meanwhile, the state Department of Education is struggling to create and communicate clear enrollment processes. This is a collision between ambition and reality—the kind of story that will play out differently across each county.

## The Teacher Shortage and Workforce Crisis

Maryland faces a severe and worsening teacher shortage. The state Department of Education reports that Maryland was short teachers in [28 subject areas in the current school year, up from 17 five years earlier.](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/03/18/marylands-teacher-shortage-will-the-blueprints-plan-for-better-pay-training-do-enough/) Specialties like English as a second language, special education, and health sciences have the most acute shortages. This is happening nationally—86% of U.S. public schools struggled to hire teachers this year—but Maryland is experiencing particularly high attrition rates in some districts.

In Prince George's County, 1,126 teachers resigned between July 2022 and July 2023, up from 989 the previous year. Montgomery County saw resignations rise from 576 to 625 in the same period. Teachers are leaving not just for higher pay out of state, but also out of burnout. The pandemic accelerated what was already happening: a long-term decline in people entering the teaching profession. According to the Harvard Graduate School of Education, people receive lifelong social messaging that "teaching isn't approved," that it's not a prestigious career choice.

The Blueprint attempts to address this through a $60,000 minimum salary and incentives for National Board Certification. But experts remain skeptical. [Researchers question whether the measures will work:](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/03/18/marylands-teacher-shortage-will-the-blueprints-plan-for-better-pay-training-do-enough/) money is important, but salary is just one of many factors driving attrition. Working conditions, class size, administrative support, and feeling valued matter too.

Also concerning: as shortages have worsened, the use of "conditional" teachers—those without full professional certifications—has more than doubled between 2018 and 2022. These less-credentialed teachers burden experienced staff who must mentor them while managing their own classrooms.

**Story idea:** Shadow a teacher recruitment team at a Maryland school district. Where are they recruiting from? What are they offering? Talk to teachers who've left the profession. What would bring them back? Interview a conditional teacher about their experience.

**Story idea:** Examine conditional certificate issuance by district. Which counties are relying most heavily on uncertified teachers? What does that tell us about which communities are being underserved?

## Chronic Absenteeism: The Silent Crisis

One of the most important stories in Maryland education is barely covered compared to the Blueprint. Nearly 27% of Maryland students were chronically absent in the 2023-2024 school year, defined as missing 10% or more of school days. That's nearly 18 days of school per year. This represents an increase of over 7 percentage points from 2018.

[Baltimore City has the worst rate, with nearly half of all public school students chronically absent.](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/02/27/thousands-of-maryland-students-are-chronically-absent-each-year-heres-what-we-know/) Some schools report rates above 90%. High school students are hit hardest, with 35% chronically absent compared to 23% of elementary students. Chronic absenteeism is also starkly racialized: over 45% of Hispanic students and over 40% of Black students are chronically absent, compared to 24% of white students and 17% of Asian students.

The causes are complex. Students cite unsafe school environments, frequent moves, family responsibilities, health issues, and transportation barriers. In Baltimore, some students travel more than 90 minutes to school. Teachers and administrators report that relationship-building, attendance incentives, and addressing the root causes of absences work better than punishment.

What's remarkable is that [one Baltimore City high school serving adult students won an award for increasing attendance by 16%](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/02/27/thousands-of-maryland-students-are-chronically-absent-each-year-heres-what-we-know/) through a combination of attendance contracts, parent conferences, and incentives like gift cards and snow tubing trips. The Maryland State Department of Education has committed to reducing the chronic absenteeism rate to 15% by next school year—an ambitious target that will require serious intervention.

This story is underreported relative to its impact on graduation rates, college enrollment, and long-term life outcomes. A single 10 absences in 9th grade reduces the probability of graduating and enrolling in college by 2%.

**Story idea:** Investigate whether your county meets the MSDE's 15% chronic absenteeism target. If not, what's the plan? Interview students and parents about why they're missing school. Talk to school officials about what works to boost attendance. Are attendance incentives being used? Are they ethical and sustainable?

**Story idea:** Map chronic absenteeism by school within a district. Are particular schools clustered? What do those schools have in common? Are they the same schools with the highest concentrations of poverty and trauma?

## Child Care: Missing in Maryland

Beneath the education system sits an even more fundamental crisis that's rarely framed as an education issue: the state has lost 15% of its child care providers and nearly 7% of its child care slots between January 2020 and January 2024. Some counties have lost a quarter or more of their providers.

This matters for education because child care is the foundation that allows families to keep kids in school. Parents can't work and pick up their kids at dismissal time if school starts at 8 and they need to be at work by 7:30. [A parent from Allegany County described her search for child care as "like winning the lottery."](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/06/25/maryland-sees-sharp-drop-in-child-care-availability-since-covid-19-pandemic/) She's been on seven waitlists since July 2023.

The child care crisis was driven by the pandemic and underlying economic dysfunction. Providers cite three main problems: financial instability (57% of surveyed Maryland providers), state regulations (48%), and staffing challenges (47%). The 1:3 staff-to-child ratio for infants, while defensible on quality grounds, makes it nearly impossible for child care businesses to turn a profit without subsidies or scale. Many providers left the field. Federal pandemic aid expired in September 2023, ending temporary support.

St. Mary's County lost 27% of its providers and 15% of its slots. Caroline County lost 26% of providers and 24% of slots. Even in Montgomery County, which fared better, infant and toddler care shortages remain severe. Across the state, parents report long waitlists, especially for children under 2.

All this happens as the Blueprint expands pre-K, potentially cannibalizing revenue from private child care centers that lose their 3- and 4-year-olds to free state programs. Child care center directors fear they'll have to close because they can't afford to keep lower-paid infant and toddler teachers on staff without older children's tuition.

**Story idea:** Do a county-by-county analysis of where child care has disappeared fastest. Interview remaining providers about whether they'll stay in business. Talk to families about the downstream effects—does lack of child care push mothers out of the workforce? Do kids end up in unlicensed care?

**Story idea:** Track how the Blueprint's pre-K expansion affects private child care centers in your county. Are any closing? Are parents finding affordable alternatives?

## Mental Health and Student Substance Abuse

Student mental health crises have intensified since the pandemic. Maryland has tried to respond through various initiatives. Governor Moore proposed $110 million in annual funding for youth mental health programs, which got cut to $40 million, then partially restored to $70 million in the fiscal 2026 budget. The final number will be around $98 million annually, ensuring services in over 80% of Maryland public schools.

But schools themselves are reluctant to screen for behavioral health issues. [Though tools like the BIMAS-2 can identify students needing mental health support, most schools don't use them](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/04/28/schools-can-screen-students-for-behavioral-health-issues-but-many-are-reluctant-to-do-so/) due to concerns about resources and responsibility. Schools lack capacity to act on screening results.

On the substance abuse front, Anne Arundel County has pioneered an interesting model. [The STAR program allows school nurses to connect middle and high school students with rapid addiction treatment services.](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/06/23/anne-arundel-schools-pioneer-rapid-response-program-for-teens-dealing-with-substance-abuse/) Since its launch, about 50 students have been referred to treatment. This addresses a real gap: there's often no clear pathway from school identification to actual treatment.

**Story idea:** Does your district have a mental health screening protocol? If so, what happens after screening? Are resources available? If not, why not? Interview school counselors and social workers about capacity gaps.

**Story idea:** Replicate the Anne Arundel STAR model investigation: Is there a program connecting students to substance abuse treatment? How many students are referred? What are treatment providers saying about demand from youth?

## Discipline, Restorative Practices, and School Safety

Schools are rethinking discipline. In Worcester County, Pocomoke High School has implemented "restorative practices," which emphasize relationship-building and conflict resolution over suspensions. The results have been striking: a 28% drop in violent incidents across the district, and Pocomoke tied for the highest graduation rate in Maryland.

[Restorative practices use "community-building circles" where students and teachers discuss issues and build relationships.](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/03/03/in-worcester-county-schools-a-turnaround-based-on-restorative-practices/) When conflicts arise, trained mediators facilitate conversations where both parties reflect on their roles and move forward. Suspensions have become rare; students work with restorative administrators to understand their behavior and set goals.

But restorative practices remain controversial. Conservative parent groups like Parents Defending Education argue they prioritize "feelings" over consequences and let dangerous behavior go unaddressed. The Delmarva Parent Teacher Coalition claims the practices are designed to "downplay, minimize and prevent reporting" of serious incidents in the name of social justice. Meanwhile, national adoption is growing—59% of schools used restorative practices in 2022, up from 42% four years earlier.

In Prince George's County, all high schools now have metal detectors. This represents a significant security measure that raises different safety concerns than restorative practices address. Some students and staff report mixed reactions.

**Story idea:** Is your local school district considering or using restorative practices? If so, what are the data on discipline rates and school safety? What do parents, teachers, and students say about the approach? Are there data on whether it actually reduces serious incidents or just reduces referrals?

**Story idea:** Investigate school safety more broadly. Are metal detectors effective? What other security measures do schools use? Have they reduced incidents? Are students more or less anxious about safety?

## The Culture Wars: Gender Identity, Book Bans, and School Board Elections

The education beat has become a proxy for national culture wars. These stories are getting significant coverage, and they're important, but they deserve skepticism and nuance.

**Transgender Student Policies:** [Carroll County's school policy requires mandatory parental notification when students wish to change their pronouns or gender identity.](https://cnsmaryland.org/2024/12/10/carroll-countys-transgender-policies-clash-with-maryland-department-of-education-guidelines/) This contradicts Maryland State Department of Education guidelines, which state schools are not required to notify parents and should make the decision based on consultation with the student. Critics argue that mandatory notification can expose students to unsupportive or abusive home environments. Advocates like Moms for Liberty counter that parents have a fundamental right to know about their children's identity issues.

This is an ongoing policy debate with no clear resolution. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in spring 2025 on [a Maryland case challenging whether parents can opt their children out of LGBTQ+-themed book lessons.](https://cnsmaryland.org/2025/05/07/supreme-court-hears-maryland-case-on-opting-children-out-from-lgbtq-book-lessons/) A decision will likely reshape these debates. Watch for it.

**Book Challenges:** Anne Arundel County designated its public libraries as "book sanctuaries" to protect challenged books from censorship. Support for book bans varies dramatically across Maryland school boards, with some candidates opposing all bans and others supporting review processes.

**School Board Elections:** In November 2024, conservative school board candidates backed by the 1776 Project PAC won or led in 11 of 19 races across Maryland. This defied expectations in a traditionally Democratic state and was characterized as a rejection of the teachers' union agenda. The 2024 school board races showed that education is a top voter concern and a vehicle for expressing broader political frustrations.

When reporting on these cultural issues, remember: a lot of the coverage is being driven by national advocacy organizations and parent groups with clear ideological commitments. Do your own reporting. Talk to local parents and educators, not just organized advocacy groups. Ask what's actually happening in schools versus what's being described in heated rhetoric.

**Story idea:** Interview school board members from your district about how gender identity policies are being handled. What guidance do teachers have? Have there been specific incidents? What's the actual impact on transgender students?

**Story idea:** Investigate book challenges in your district. What books are being challenged? Who is challenging them? Are challenges increasing? What's the approval rate for challenges? Talk to librarians about their experience.

**Story idea:** Cover school board candidates' actual platforms, not just the ones promoted by advocacy groups. What do they actually say about their vision for schools?

Check back in 6-12 months on closures.**

4. **Teacher Recruitment Effectiveness:** Are the Blueprint's pay increases and loan forgiveness programs actually bringing new teachers into the profession? Are they stemming attrition? Which districts are doing well? Which are still struggling? **Track one or two teacher recruitment cohorts through a full school year.**

5. **Restorative Practices' Long-Term Impact:** Does Worcester County's dramatic drop in violent incidents hold? Are other districts adopting the model? What do incident reports show over time? Are critics' concerns about unreported serious incidents valid? **Follow the data over 2-3 years.**

### Investigative Angles

1. **Where Are the Missing Child Care Slots?** Survey child care providers who closed. What happened to families who were relying on them? Are children ending up in unlicensed care? Are women leaving the workforce? This is an economic and child welfare story, not just an education story.

2. **The Conditional Teacher Phenomenon:** Which districts rely most on uncertified teachers? What happens to student outcomes in classrooms with multiple conditional teachers? Are these teachers getting adequate support or being set up to fail? **Focus on high-poverty districts that likely have the highest rates.**

3. **Who Gets Restorative Practices?** As the approach spreads, do school communities with more resources implement it better than high-poverty schools? Are there disparities in who benefits from relationship-building approaches?

4. **Blueprint Implementation Variation:** Are wealthier districts implementing the Blueprint faster and more fully than poorer ones? Is the plan exacerbating or reducing inequality? **Compare two districts with very different resources.**

5. **The Math of Pre-K Expansion:** Model out the actual costs and enrollment under the Blueprint's pre-K plan. Are the projections realistic? Will the state hit enrollment targets? What happens to private child care?

### Trend Stories

1. **The Rise of Gender Identity Policies:** How many Maryland districts have policies on transgender student rights? Do they align with state guidelines or contradict them? Is there a pattern to which districts are more restrictive? **This is about policy variation, not opinion pieces.**

2. **School Board Elections and Culture War Messaging:** The 1776 Project's success in 2024 suggests continued focus on school board races. What are the 2026 priorities? Which candidates are running on education quality versus culture war issues?

3. **Mental Health Crises in Schools:** Is the state's investment in youth mental health services actually reaching students who need it? Are schools equipped to handle the demand? What's the gap between need and services? **Talk to school counselors and social workers.**

4. **Cellphones in Schools:** Multiple Maryland districts are implementing cellphone restrictions. Are they working? Do they improve focus and reduce distractions? What's the pushback from students and parents? Some reports suggest they do help; others suggest the impact is overstated.

### Underreported Beats

1. **Dual Enrollment and Career Readiness:** The Blueprint emphasizes college and career readiness and dual enrollment programs. Is this working? Are high school students actually earning college credits? Are career tech programs filling workforce gaps? **This is largely untouched in coverage.**

2. **English Language Learner Services:** How are schools serving the growing population of immigrant and multilingual students? Are services adequate? What's happening with refugee students? **Very little coverage of this critical population.**

3. **Students with Disabilities:** How is the Blueprint addressing special education? Are special educators being recruited and retained? What's happening with special education funding under the new system?

4. **Higher Education Pipeline:** How are Maryland's teacher preparation programs responding to the shortage? Are enrollments increasing? What programs are most effective at producing new teachers who stay in the profession?

## Reporting Checklist for Education Stories

**For any Blueprint story:**
- Get comment from the Accountability and Implementation Board (Rachel Hise)
- Check if the district has submitted required reports to the board
- Compare what was promised to what's actually happening

- Talk to both administrators and teachers; their perspectives often diverge

**For teacher shortage stories:**
- Get data on subject-area shortages in your district
- Interview actual teacher candidates about why they chose to teach or not
- Talk to teachers who've left the profession about what would bring them back
- Check conditional certificate data

**For chronic absenteeism stories:**
- Get district data on which schools/grades have highest rates
- Look for demographic patterns
- Interview students and parents about reasons
- Talk to attendance interventionists about what works

**For child care stories:**
- Survey local providers about their plans
- Track waitlist length and demand
- Interview families struggling to find care

- **June-July:** End of school year. Good time for impact stories and analysis of what happened.
  
- **July-August:** Budget season often plays out here. Watch for Blueprint funding decisions.
  
- **September:** School starts. Chronicle how many teachers didn't return, how classes are staffed, whether new initiatives launched.
  
- **Fall:** School board elections occur in odd-numbered years (next: 2025). Culture war stories intensify.
  
- **October-November:** MSDE releases updated data on graduation rates, NAEP scores (sometimes), and other measures. Use these to prompt enterprise reporting.
  
- **January-February:** New legislative session brings education bills. New governor budget proposals emerge.

## Recommended Reading to Get Up to Speed

1. Start with the "Behind the Blueprint" series from Capital News Service/Local News Network. It includes district-by-district analysis and explainers of each pillar.

2. Read the Accountability and Implementation Board's annual reports and meeting minutes (they're public).

3. Review the Maryland State Department of Education's guidance documents and data dashboards.

4. Follow the education reporters at the Capital News Service and major metro papers. See how they frame stories.

5. Read research from the University of Maryland College of Education on teacher diversity and school leadership.

## Final Thought

Education reporting in Maryland right now sits at the intersection of grand policy ambitions and grinding implementation reality. The Blueprint promises transformation but is running into the messiness of actual schools—budget constraints, teacher burnout, child care collapse, and the fact that changing how people teach and learn is hard, slow work. Meanwhile, cultural debates over whose values schools should transmit have become louder and more polarized.

Your job as an education journalist is to help readers understand both the big picture (What is the Blueprint actually accomplishing?) and the ground truth (What's happening in schools in your community?). Don't let the policy debate distract from reporting on whether kids are actually showing up to school, learning, and graduating. Don't let the culture wars prevent you from investigating the systemic issues—like child care collapse and teacher exodus—that affect every student, regardless of politics. Get in schools. Talk to teachers when they're not performing for administrators. Listen to what students say when they're not being used as props in adults' debates.

The education beat is essential because schools are one of the few institutions where almost everyone has a stake. Do it well, and you're doing accountability journalism that matters.
