# CNS Topic Analysis 
10/3/2025

Observations:
1. Overall I felt the stories were just right. Some were too broad or left a lot of questions lingering. For example the "Maryland small businesses get $10 million grant" story had me wondering if any student small business could win it? What were the criterias? Who had won some funding before? Just more information on the background of the Maryland Technology Development Corporation and who they have helped before. These broad "good" stories feel like a distracting win for the state. Something to make Maryland look good. 
2. In between the heavy political or troubling stories, there were a few "feel good" or positive stories that stood out. They stood out only because it was a surprise after the skimming the heavier stories before. 
3. CNS makes a lot of connections of national issues or political issues impacting Maryland. I applause this because sometimes - though we are not far from D.C. - some individuals see us not being there as being too far away for the issues to impact us too. 
4. Increase in stories within this year (topics):
- economy (budgetting, cuts, loss, etc)
- immigrantion
- environment
- housing
- hate-crime (increase of, or organizatios formed against it)
- homelessness 
5. What I haven't seen:
- More local - like college park - news. They reported on the bar Bentley's owner passing away, but there aren't a lot of local news. Which is surpising because we've been having more protests around campus. 
- Protests. In DC or local (like on-cmapus, as mentioned above). I noticed a trend of protest stories being published at the beginning of the year, with one or two outliers.
- Reporting on the DC militarization. 

Analyze Topics
1. Agriculture and Food - Not a frequent topic but good way of grouping the topic 
2. Animals - There are not a lot of animal stories. The different type of animal stories revolve around protection and medicine and relationships. Each broad and different enough where keeping it as 'animals' works. 
3. Armed Forces and National Security - I did not see any stories involving armed forces and national security but I would break down this category. I can see military stories grouped under this topic which will make it complicated. Dividing this into National security, and military (armed forces can go here and other branches). We could also break into law enforcement since there isn't listed below.
4. Arts & Culture - This is a good category for community based events or stories involving local culture. There are few of these stories, they're all swept under the rug by all the federal and other political conflicts. This topic could be expanded a little by adding "& Community" because there are some stories that are just information about the community or something occuring that are not necessarily art or culture. 
5. Civil Rights - Clear and distinct 
6. Commerce - Clear and distinct. Not too broad but also not too narow where it can include different types commerce. 
7. Congress - This is a good topic name to encompass Congress and everyone under, but I feel we need to have Surpeme Court as well if we are having Congress. 
8. Justice - I think this is too broad. I can see court cases going here and law enforcement but a lot of stories can be produced by one incident/case that I think dividing them will help with organization. 
9. Budget - To stay specific and avoid overlapping, budget definitely could be it's own topic. I also see it grouped with economy though, along with cuts,  
10. Education - Yes.
11. Elections - Yes. It could also be specific with local vs. state vs. federal
12. Emergency Management - I don't think I saw a story for this specifically. Maybe the Key Bridge in baltimore and it's response to it but I think this topic needs to be better defined. 
13. Energy - Yes. This can dive into non-renewable and renewable energy. 
14. Environmental Protection - Yes. 
15. Families - Yes. 
16. Economy - Yes. 
17. Trade - I think this goes with commerce too. Maybe we can do a "trade and commerce" topic. 
18. Maryland Government and Politics - Yes
19. Federal Government and Politics - Yes but I think it overlaps with Congress. 
20. Health - Yes. 
21. Housing - Yes. 
22. Immigration - Yes. 
23. International Affairs - Yes. Foreign relations and policy could go under this topic. 
24. Labor and Employment - Yes. 
25. Law - Yes, but this could cover court cases and judge decisions.
26. Native Americans - A very specific topic, and I saw one story where this topic would be used.
27. Natural Resources - I think this could be a sub section for energy, environmental protection, and possibly law - if any laws are broken involving natural resources. 
28. Science & Technology - Yes but I see a risk of it being too complicated. Cyber-related stories can fall into this category and more.
29. History - Yes.
30. Social Welfare - Yes, but I definitely see overlapping with this topic and others. 
31. Sports - Yes. 
32. Taxes - I see this going under 'taxes and commerce'
33. Transportation and Public Works - Yes. 
34. Chesapeake Bay - Yes.
35. Baltimore - Yes.
