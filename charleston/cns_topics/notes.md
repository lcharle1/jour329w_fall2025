# CNS Topic Analysis 
10/3/2025

Observations:
1. Overall I felt the stories were just right. Some were too broad or left a lot of questions lingering. For example the "Maryland small businesses get $10 million grant" story had me wondering if any student small business could win it? What were the criterias? Who had won some funding before? Just more information on the background of the Maryland Technology Development Corporation and who they have helped before. These broad "good" stories feel like a distracting win for the state. Something to make Maryland look good. 
2. In between the heavy political or troubling stories, there were a few "feel good" or positive stories that stood out. They stood out only because it was a surprise after the skimming the heavier stories before. 
3. CNS makes a lot of connections of national issues or political issues impacting Maryland. I applause this because sometimes - though we are not far from D.C. - some individuals see us not being there as being too far away for the issues to impact us too. 
4. Increase in stories within this year (topics):
- economy (budgetting, cuts, loss, etc)
- immigrantion
- environment
- housing
- hate-crime (increase of, or organizatios formed against it)
- homelessness 
5. What I haven't seen:
- More local - like college park - news. They reported on the bar Bentley's owner passing away, but there aren't a lot of local news. Which is surpising because we've been having more protests around campus. 
- Protests. In DC or local (like on-cmapus, as mentioned above). I noticed a trend of protest stories being published at the beginning of the year, with one or two outliers.
- Reporting on the DC militarization. 

Analyze Topics
1. Agriculture and Food - Not a frequent topic but good way of grouping the topic 
2. Animals - There are not a lot of animal stories. The different type of animal stories revolve around protection and medicine and relationships. Each broad and different enough where keeping it as 'animals' works. 
3. Armed Forces and National Security - I did not see any stories involving armed forces and national security but I would break down this category. I can see military stories grouped under this topic which will make it complicated. Dividing this into National security, and military (armed forces can go here and other branches). We could also break into law enforcement since there isn't listed below.
4. Arts & Culture - This is a good category for community based events or stories involving local culture. There are few of these stories, they're all swept under the rug by all the federal and other political conflicts. This topic could be expanded a little by adding "& Community" because there are some stories that are just information about the community or something occuring that are not necessarily art or culture. 
5. Civil Rights - Clear and distinct. Not a lot of stories really mention or invole civil rights.
6. Commerce - Clear and distinct. Not too broad but also not too narow where it can include different types commerce. 
7. Congress - This is a good topic name to encompass Congress and everyone under, but I feel we need to have Surpeme Court as well if we are having Congress. 
8. Justice - I think this is too broad. I can see court cases going here and law enforcement, both of which can produce a lot of stories.
9. Budget - To stay specific and avoid overlapping, budget definitely could be it's own topic. I also see it grouped with economy though, along with cuts,  
10. Education - Yes.
11. Elections - Yes. It could also be specific with local vs. state vs. federal
12. Emergency Management - I don't think I saw a story for this specifically. Maybe the Key Bridge in baltimore and it's response to it or firefighters/ first responders stories. Good to keep.
13. Energy - Yes. This can dive into non-renewable and renewable energy. 
14. Environmental Protection - Yes. 
15. Families - I think stories involving families can go under art and culture and community topic
16. Economy - Yes. 
17. Trade - I think this goes with commerce too. Maybe we can do a "trade and commerce" topic. 
18. Maryland Government and Politics - Yes
19. Federal Government and Politics - Yes but I think it overlaps with Congress. 
20. Health - Yes. 
21. Housing - Yes. 
22. Immigration - Yes. 
23. International Affairs - Yes. Foreign relations and policy could go under this topic. 
24. Labor and Employment - Yes. 
25. Law - Yes, and this could cover court cases and judge decisions.
26. Native Americans - A very specific topic, and I saw one story where this topic would be used.
27. Natural Resources - I think this could be a sub section for energy, environmental protection, and possibly law - if any laws are broken involving natural resources. 
28. Science & Technology - Yes and cyber-related stories can fall into this category and more.
29. History - Yes.
30. Social Welfare - Yes, but I definitely see overlapping with this topic and others. Like economic security is a social welfare issue but would go under economy and social welfare, maybe health depending on the story. Similarly for any homelessness stories, it would fit under social welfare but also housing and maybe more depending on the story. 
31. Sports - Yes. 
32. Taxes - I see this going under 'trade and commerce'
33. Transportation and Public Works - Yes. 
34. Chesapeake Bay - I see the interest of making this into a topic but I don't think its necessary since the story involving the area will be about a more specific topic. 
35. Baltimore - I see the interest of making this into a topic but I don't think its necessary since the story involving the area will be about a more specific topic. 


Revised Topic List:

My list include topics above I think are good to keep and some combinations or broken down topics. 

1. Agriculture and food
2. Animal
3. National Security
4. Military
5. Arts and Culture and Community - I added community and removed the 'Families' topic because I feel these types of story have the same sense of bringing the community together or informing, but not every story like that might include art or culture. Like CNS's story on the man recovering through rock climbing, the Golden ID program, and the Germantown senior aiming to compete in the 2028 paralympics.
6. Law Enforcement
7. Elections 
8. Education 
9. Emergency Management
10. Energy
11. Environmental protection
12. Economy 
13. Trade and Commerce 
14. Maryland Government and Politics
15. Federal Government and Politics
16. Health 
17. Housing 
18. Immigration 
19. International Affairs
20. Labor and employment 
21. Law - Congress would go here too, along with other stories involving the judicial branch. 
22. Native Americans 
23. Natural Resources
24. Science and Technology 
25. History
26. Sports
27. Transportation and public works

I removed Chesapeake Bay and Baltimore because I think the content of the stories would align better to a specific topic than just the city. 

I removed taxes and grouped it Commerce and Trade.
