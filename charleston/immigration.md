# Guide to Immigration Coverage in Maryland and the United States

## Understanding the Immigration Landscape

Immigration is one of the most complex and emotionally charged topics in American politics, particularly affecting Maryland due to its proximity to Washington, D.C., and its substantial immigrant population. As a journalist new to this beat, you'll need to understand both the policy mechanics and the human impact of immigration decisions.

### Key Population Statistics

Maryland is home to approximately 1 million immigrants, representing about 15% of the state's population. The largest groups come from El Salvador, India, Ethiopia, China, and the Philippines. Prince George's County and Montgomery County host the largest immigrant populations in the state, with Montgomery County alone housing more than 30% of Maryland's immigrants.

Approximately 275,000 undocumented immigrants live in Maryland as of recent estimates. The state also has roughly 9,700 DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, though this number fluctuates with policy changes.

### Geographic Concentrations

Immigration stories concentrate in several key areas:

**Montgomery County**: Home to about 8,000 DACA-eligible individuals and substantial populations from Latin America. Langley Park is particularly significant—83% of its 22,000 residents are Hispanic, many undocumented. This community serves as a hub for day laborers and has been repeatedly affected by ICE enforcement actions.

**Prince George's County**: Houses approximately 6,000 DACA-eligible residents and has experienced significant ICE activity, particularly in communities like Hyattsville and areas near the D.C. border.

**Baltimore**: Nearly half of Maryland's refugees since 2000 have resettled in Baltimore, where the population has been declining. The city's foreign-born population has grown from under 6% in the 1990s to about 8% today. Jamaicans represent the city's largest immigrant group, concentrated in the Park Heights neighborhood.

**Eastern Shore**: Dorchester, Wicomico, and Somerset counties are agricultural areas heavily dependent on H-2B visa workers, particularly in the seafood processing industry. These counties also have 287(g) agreements or detention contracts with ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement).

## Key Institutions and Players

### Federal Level

**U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)**: The primary enforcement agency. In Maryland, ICE operates through partnerships with local jurisdictions via 287(g) agreements (Cecil, Frederick, and Harford counties) and detention contracts (Howard, Frederick, and Worcester counties). These agreements allow local officers to perform immigration enforcement functions.

**U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)**: Processes immigration applications, including DACA renewals, work permits, and naturalization. Processing times in Maryland range from 10-15.5 months for naturalization applications.

**Department of Homeland Security (DHS)**: Oversees immigration policy and enforcement. Under the Trump administration, DHS significantly expanded enforcement priorities and detention operations.

### State and Local

**Maryland Office for Refugees and Asylees**: Part of the Department of Human Services, this office coordinates refugee resettlement. Maryland accepts a disproportionate share of national refugees—in recent years taking 2.8% of refugees despite representing only 1.85% of the U.S. population.

**Governor's Office**: Shapes Maryland's response to federal immigration policy. The state has generally taken a protective stance toward immigrants, though this varies by administration.

**Local Law Enforcement**: Jurisdictions differ dramatically in cooperation with ICE. Harford County Sheriff Jeffrey Gahler actively defends his 287(g) partnership, while jurisdictions like Takoma Park and Hyattsville have declared themselves sanctuary cities. Anne Arundel County ended its detention agreement with ICE in 2019 under County Executive Steuart Pittman.

### Advocacy Organizations

**CASA de Maryland**: The largest Latino and immigrant advocacy organization in the region, headquartered in Langley Park. CASA provides legal services, operates worker centers with wage floors, offers DACA application assistance, and actively litigates against immigration enforcement actions. They've helped more than 3,000 immigrants with DACA applications and operate welcome centers where employers must agree to pay at least $10/hour (often $12-20).

**International Rescue Committee (Baltimore office)**: Major refugee resettlement organization led by Krish O'Mara Vignarajah. Faces ongoing funding challenges due to reduced refugee admissions.

**Episcopal Refugee and Immigrant Center Alliance**: Led by Executive Director Betty Symington, provides housing, emergency assistance, and education services.

**Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service**: Baltimore-based, provides resettlement services. Has been impacted by reduced refugee caps and federal funding changes.

**UndocuBlack**: Supports undocumented Black immigrants, an often-overlooked community in immigration discussions.

### Legal Services

**Community Legal Services of Prince George's County**: Handles frequent wage theft cases and provides worker's rights representation.

**Immigrant Legal Resource Center**: National organization with Maryland connections, provides legal support and policy advocacy.

**University of Baltimore Immigrants Rights Clinic**: Led by Professor Elizabeth Keyes, offers legal services and takes on impact litigation.

## Current and Ongoing Issues

### Birthright Citizenship

One of the most significant ongoing stories involves the CASA v. Trump lawsuit filed in January 2025 after Trump issued an executive order attempting to restrict birthright citizenship. The case includes five pregnant women (including Maryland resident "Meny") as plaintiffs. 

**Story angles to pursue**: The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in May 2025. This is an unresolved, active case. Follow up on:
- How the Supreme Court ruling (expected in 2025) affects Maryland families
- The implementation challenges if the administration wins
- The impact on Maryland's healthcare system and social services
- How the state is preparing for various outcomes
- Interviews with expectant mothers in immigrant communities about their planning

**Caveat**: This case is still in litigation. The outcome is uncertain, and any reporting should clearly state that the issue hasn't been resolved.

### Workplace Enforcement and Economic Impact

In May 2025, DHS agents visited over 100 businesses in the Washington area, including numerous restaurants in D.C. Without warrants, agents served Notice of Inspections requiring employers to turn over I-9 forms within three days. Notable Maryland locations included the seafood industry on the Eastern Shore.

**Follow-up opportunities**:
- The actual outcomes of these raids remain unclear. Did arrests occur? Were businesses cited? What happened to the workers whose information was turned over?
- Interview restaurant owners and workers about the long-term impact on operations
- Track whether similar raids have occurred in Maryland jurisdictions
- Investigate the economic ripple effects in affected industries
- Document the human stories of workers who lost jobs or went into hiding

The seafood industry story is particularly rich. Maryland's Eastern Shore depends heavily on H-2B workers (temporary non-agricultural workers) for crab picking and seafood processing. A 2021 investigation revealed that these workers traveled together on buses during COVID-19 without testing requirements, often worked the day after arrival, and faced outbreaks with limited safety measures. Companies like Lindy's Seafood near Cambridge continue to rely on these workers.

**Undercovered angles**:
- Living conditions for H-2B workers in rural Maryland
- The absence of state-level safety standards for guest workers
- Wage structures in the seafood industry and whether they've changed
- The intersection of immigration status and workplace safety violations
- How climate change affecting crab populations impacts demand for these workers

### Deportation Cases and Family Separation

The case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia received significant coverage in 2025. Garcia, a Maryland resident with legal protection from deportation granted in 2019, was arrested by ICE and deported to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. Despite orders from a federal judge, appeals court, and Supreme Court to facilitate his return, the Trump administration refused. Senator Chris Van Hollen traveled to El Salvador in April 2025 to check on Garcia's welfare.

**Story opportunities**:
- What happened to Garcia? Did he ever return to the U.S.?
- How many other Maryland residents have been deported despite having legal protections?
- The ongoing litigation against the administration
- The impact on Garcia's family in Maryland
- Similar cases that didn't receive media attention

**Caveat**: As of the latest coverage in April 2025, this situation remained unresolved. Any reporting must indicate the uncertain status.

### Detention Facilities and Contracts

Maryland has three ICE detention facilities (Howard, Frederick, and Worcester counties). As of 2019, these jurisdictions received approximately $7.8 million in federal payments. Howard County's facility, run by Department of Corrections Director Jack Kavanagh, has brought in nearly $20 million since 2013, charging ICE $110 per inmate per day for about 95 beds (typically 65 full).

**Undercovered questions**:
- What are current conditions in these facilities?
- Have there been COVID-19 outbreaks since 2020?
- How much revenue have these contracts generated recently?
- What oversight exists? How often are facilities inspected?
- Interview former detainees about their experiences
- Examine the financial incentives for counties to maintain these contracts
- What legal services are available to detainees?

Several bills to restrict or end these contracts have been introduced in the Maryland General Assembly (including the Dignity Not Detention Act), but none have passed. This represents a continuing story about the tension between local revenue needs and immigrant rights concerns.

### DACA and Young Immigrants

DACA remains in legal limbo despite a December 2020 court ruling that restored the program. As of 2025, processing continues but the program's long-term future is uncertain. Maryland had approximately 9,700 recipients as of early 2025.

**Follow-up opportunities**:
- Track individual stories of DACA recipients over time (now in their late 20s and 30s)
- How has prolonged uncertainty affected life decisions—marriage, home buying, career choices?
- The impact on Maryland's economy and workforce
- Universities' responses to protecting DACA students
- Legal battles and how they're progressing
- Interview the now-adult "dreamers" who testified before Congress about their experiences

### Wage Theft and Worker Exploitation

Day laborers in Langley Park and similar areas routinely accept wages below minimum wage due to oversupply of workers. CASA documented that workers in their network average $10,000-15,000 annually. Non-CASA workers frequently bid themselves down to $5/hour, well below Maryland's minimum wage.

**Story ideas**:
- Document the day labor market systematically—how many workers, how many jobs, actual wages paid
- Investigate specific employers who regularly hire below minimum wage
- Examine enforcement: Does Maryland's Department of Labor investigate these violations?
- Explore the legal ambiguity around independent contractors vs. employees
- Profile workers over time to understand the economic reality of this work
- Investigate whether the Trump administration's enforcement priorities have changed worker behavior
- Look at wage theft cases that went through legal channels—what were the outcomes?

### Refugee Resettlement

The Trump administration reduced refugee admissions to historic lows (18,000 in 2020). Maryland has consistently accepted a higher proportion of refugees than its population share would suggest. Baltimore receives nearly half of the state's refugees.

**Underreported angles**:
- How have resettlement organizations adapted to reduced funding and caseloads?
- Have any organizations closed offices or laid off staff?
- Profile recent refugee families—where are they from now? How has the demographic mix changed?
- What services are still available vs. what has been cut?
- How have Afghan refugees who arrived after the U.S. withdrawal adjusted?
- The long-term integration of refugees in Maryland—employment, education, housing

### Temporary Protected Status (TPS)

Approximately 22,500 TPS holders live in Maryland from 10 designated countries. The Trump administration terminated TPS for several countries, though extensions have been granted. Salvadorans represent the largest TPS population in Maryland.

**Story opportunities**:
- What is the current status of various TPS designations?
- Profile families where parents have TPS but children are U.S. citizens
- The economic contributions of TPS holders
- How employers in industries that rely on TPS workers are preparing for potential terminations
- Legal challenges to TPS terminations and their status

### Chinese Students and Visa Revocations

A May 2025 story noted that hundreds of Chinese exchange students had visas revoked amid U.S.-China tensions, with Trump administration policies targeting students allegedly posing security threats. Many Maryland universities host Chinese students.

**Follow-up needed**:
- How many Chinese students in Maryland have been affected?
- What is happening to them?
- How are universities responding?
- Interview affected students about their experiences
- Examine the academic and research impact
- Look at the economic impact on universities

## Immigration Policy Mechanisms You Need to Understand

### DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals)

Created by Obama in 2012, DACA provides two-year renewable work permits and deportation protection for individuals who:
- Arrived before age 16
- Were under 31 as of June 15, 2012
- Have lived continuously in the U.S. since June 15, 2007
- Meet education requirements
- Have no serious criminal convictions

The application costs $495 and requires extensive documentation. Trump attempted to end DACA in 2017; the Supreme Court blocked termination in 2020, but the program's future remains uncertain. New applications were blocked from 2017-2020; they resumed after a court order in December 2020.

### 287(g) Agreements

These agreements between ICE and local law enforcement allow officers to perform immigration enforcement functions. In Maryland, Cecil, Frederick, and Harford counties have these agreements. Critics argue they lead to racial profiling and damage community trust; supporters say they enhance public safety by identifying criminal aliens.

### Intergovernmental Service Agreements (IGSAs)

These are detention contracts where ICE rents jail space from local jurisdictions. Howard, Frederick, and Worcester counties have these agreements in Maryland. They're lucrative for counties but controversial.

### H-2B Visa Program

Allows employers to hire foreign workers for temporary non-agricultural jobs. Maryland's seafood industry is heavily dependent on these visas. The program has an annual cap of 66,000 visas (33,000 per half-year), often insufficient for demand. Extensions have been granted but remain controversial.

### Special Immigrant Visas (SIVs)

Granted to Afghans and Iraqis who worked with U.S. forces. Maryland received 330 Afghan SIV holders between October 2020 and August 2021. The process is complex and lengthy.

### Temporary Protected Status (TPS)

Granted to nationals of countries experiencing armed conflict, natural disasters, or other extraordinary conditions. TPS allows work authorization but doesn't provide a path to permanent residency. It must be renewed periodically by the administration.

## Ethical Considerations

**Protecting Sources**: Always use pseudonyms for undocumented immigrants unless they explicitly consent to using their names. Even then, consider the risks. Don't publish addresses, specific workplaces, or other identifying details. Be cautious about photos—faces can be identified.

**Understanding Power Dynamics**: Recognize that immigrants, especially those without legal status, are in an extremely vulnerable position. They may not feel free to refuse an interview request. Make sure participation is truly voluntary.

**Avoiding Harm**: Consider whether a story, even if accurate, could expose individuals or communities to enforcement action. This doesn't mean avoiding tough stories, but it does mean thinking through consequences.

**Language and Framing**: Use "undocumented" rather than "illegal." The term "illegal alien" is dehumanizing and has been abandoned by most major news organizations. Be precise about immigration status—there are many categories between "citizen" and "undocumented."

**Context Matters**: Immigration violations are civil, not criminal offenses (except for illegal re-entry after deportation). Most undocumented immigrants have never been convicted of any crime. These facts provide important context.

## Looking Forward: Story Ideas

1. **Economic Impact Analysis**: Maryland has not done comprehensive recent analysis of how immigration enforcement affects specific industries. Pick one industry (seafood, restaurants, construction) and document the economic ripple effects of enforcement actions.

2. **Children of Mixed-Status Families**: Profile families where some members are citizens and others aren't. How do they navigate this complexity? What happens to citizen children if parents are deported?

3. **Local Government Responses**: Compare how different Maryland jurisdictions are responding to federal immigration policy. Create a database of policies and practices across all counties and major cities.

4. **Long-term DACA Recipients**: Find recipients who got DACA in 2012 and follow them through more than a decade of uncertainty. They're now in their 30s. What life decisions did they make or postpone? How has prolonged limbo affected their mental health?

5. **Detention Facility Investigation**: Use freedom of information requests to get inspection reports, medical records (anonymized), incident reports, and financial records from Maryland's three detention facilities. Document conditions systematically.

6. **Worker Center Evolution**: CASA's model of setting wage floors is interesting. Has it worked? Do workers make more? Have other communities replicated it? What are the challenges?

7. **Refugee Integration**: Pick one refugee community (Congolese, Eritrean, Afghan) and document their integration into Maryland over several years. What worked? What didn't? What services made the difference?

8. **Immigration Courts Backlog**: Maryland's immigration courts have a significant backlog. What does this mean in human terms? Find people who have been waiting years for hearings. What happens to their lives during this limbo?

9. **University Response**: How are Maryland universities protecting undocumented students? What services exist? What are the gaps? How has this changed over time?

10. **Mixed-Status Military Families**: Service members with undocumented family members face particular challenges. Find these stories in Maryland's military communities (Fort Meade, Andrews AFB, Aberdeen Proving Ground).

## Conclusion

Immigration coverage requires understanding complex policy while never losing sight of human impact. The best stories combine data analysis with compelling individual narratives. Always be skeptical of official numbers—many immigrants don't interact with systems that count them. Be patient with sources who have good reason to be wary of journalists. And remember that for many people you interview, the stakes couldn't be higher—you're documenting stories about whether families will stay together or be torn apart, whether people can work and support their children, and fundamentally, whether people can remain in the only country many have known.

Keep pushing for accountability from all institutions involved—federal enforcement agencies, local law enforcement, employers, and advocacy organizations. There are important stories in the gaps between policy and practice, and in the unintended consequences of even well-meaning actions.
