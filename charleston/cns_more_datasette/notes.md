#### Enrichment 2: Topics
Topic: Chesapeake Bay 

1. Tags vs. GPT_Keywords. GPT_keywords is more specific or relevant in a different way than tags. The first story (rowid 128) has "crabbers" for tags but the GPT_Keywords has "Seafood Industry" and "Restaurant owners". Crabbers is a bit too narrow and I don't feel shows the purpose of the story."Seafood Industry" and "Restaurant owners" are also words in the summary. The tags include the economic side "inflation" and "tarriff" and "sales" whereas keywords just says "inflation". There is a difference in what each column prioritizes. The second story (rowid 204), the tags mentions DOGE, a key finding, but not the focus of the sotry. Whereas GPT_Keyword focuses on environment, which tags don't mention. They can be similar or show two different POVs of a story. 
2. GPT_keywords will include the topic as a keyword. 
3. Back to the conversation of keeping Chesapeake Bay as a topic, majority of the stories written include environment or policy, mainly environment, the one deviation I saw was about tourism due to a stranded cargo ship. 


### Working with Embeddings
1. The similarity percentage is a cool tool. Good to compare what stories and tags are more or less similar to certain phrases. Within the first five stories I saw a repititon is tags including "Annapolis". This gives a good idea that a lot of policies or fiscal policy related work comes from there. 
2. It was a little surprising the tags didn't include "fiscal policy" or "policy". The first close result I saw was "legislature" at the probability of 0.2171, and "lawmakers" at 0.2343 probabilty.
