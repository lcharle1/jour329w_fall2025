# CNS Datasette Analysis 10/1/2025

1. The most interesting thing I saw was the use of sql. I took a sql class - but I do not remember a lot of commands - and I find sql to be a simple language. To use and read. 

2. The most useful thing was using SQL to filter and search for tags the same way I had envisioned for my webpage to work. With the tags and the topics selection narrowing down the available stories and tags. 

3. This Datasette has a lot of potential of helping with the analysis. It can label the stories with more details than the json format. It can also provide a description, so we can get a better brief understanding of what the story and the tag is about rather than the small "slug" category. 

4. For search optimization and inspections (for the tags). As mentioned in class, this method of organizing and filtering through the dataset is more precise than ctrl + F and searching for text. 

5. As mentioned above, it is more precise than ctrl + F and searching through the dataset and it provides more criterias to search through. Like how I could combine the fitlering of tags and topics in class.
